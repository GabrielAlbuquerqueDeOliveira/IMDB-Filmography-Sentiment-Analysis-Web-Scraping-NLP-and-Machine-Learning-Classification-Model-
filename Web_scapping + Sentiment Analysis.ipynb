    "This project uses Python web scraping techniques to collect movie reviews from the IMDb website. It then applies text pre-processing and NLP methods to train and evaluate a machine learning model, with the goal of performing a comprehensive sentiment analysis. The model classifies user reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, allowing us to extract key insights into the public's reception of an actor's filmography."

    "\n",
    "This project is a comprehensive analysis of Tom Cruise's films, focusing on using data to understand audience sentiment. The core objective is to collect thousands of movie reviews from IMDb and apply machine learning techniques to determine if a review is positive, neutral, or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The project is structured into three main phases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Acquisition:* We began by developing a Python-based web scraping tool to systematically extract movie titles, ratings, and user reviews directly from the IMDb website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Pre-processing:* Next, we cleaned and prepared the unstructured text data. This involved critical steps like tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization to transform the raw reviews into a format a machine learning model can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Model Training & Analysis:* Finally, we'll use the cleaned data to train and evaluate different machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to accurately classify sentiment. The ultimate goal is to find a model that can reliably predict sentiment and gain insights into audience opinions."

The beginning felt like an introduction, which might be necessary for first time mission impossible viewers, though quite repetitive for those who have seen Dead Reckoning. The flashbacks and flashforwards to explain the story was a lazy choice in my opinion and it was one the big negatives in this film. The whole story is constantly being explained leaving no room for mystery, some intrigue or some unpredictable moments. Actually it becomes almost annoying because the dialogue is just sloppy, leaving very little for the actors to work with. Fortunately some momentum is gained as the movie progresses, mainly from the stunts which are absolutely incredible and let's be honest, you probably won't find anything that comes close in any other type of media. Though this momentum doesn't last long because of all the explaining again and the bad guys seeming to be there only for show. What I'm trying to say is that Yes the action sequences are obviously the main selling point of MI but not the only one.

Yet, it lacks a true sense of finality.The film shoulders a colossal burden, attempting to deliver a worthy goodbye to Ethan Hunt and the iconic franchise. It aims to provide satisfying conclusions to a bloated roster of side characters while also setting up inevitable cash-grab sequels. Additionally, it strives to outdo every previous installment by going bigger and bolder than ever. While it excels in some areas, it falters in others.One of the film's biggest challenges is managing its vast ensemble of characters. The script occasionally struggles to balance them all, resulting in scenes where some characters randomly appear and disappear, seemingly out of convenience rather than logic. This inconsistency can be jarring, pulling the audience out of the experience.In typical Mission Impossible fashion, the film promises the most spectacular set pieces yet-and it delivers. These grand, meticulously crafted action sequences are thrilling to watch. However, their constant back-to-back presence somewhat dampens their impact. Once the audience becomes accustomed to the relentless spectacle, the element of surprise and tension starts to wane.The stunts, while still impressive, carry a bittersweet note. Unlike previous installments where Tom Cruise's daring feats were fully captured on camera, this time around, roughly half of the action scenes rely on noticeable green screen effects. Though understandable, given Cruise's age and safety precautions, it slightly detracts from the visceral thrill of witnessing genuine stunts, making the danger feel less real.Performance-wise, this installment shines, particularly with Angela Bassett delivering one of the most emotionally charged portrayals in the franchise. The script's emphasis on deeper emotions allows for some of the finest acting moments in the series.However, the editing feels somewhat sloppy, giving the impression that substantial material was left on the cutting room floor. While the brisk pacing keeps the film engaging, it sometimes feels as if we're only witnessing the start and end of scenes without the journey in between, leaving a sense of incompleteness. The cutting is fast, but not in an exhilarating manner-instead, it's disorienting.If this truly is the final goodbye to the Mission Impossible series, it's been an unforgettable ride. Despite its flaws, the franchise remains the pinnacle of action cinema in my book, and its legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: we are witnessing a master at craft. Cherish it while you can.This message will self-destruct in five seconds.\", 'rating': '8', 'title': \"A goodbye that doesn't feel like one\"}, {'movie_id': 'tt9603208', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning', 'review_body': \"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a bit of a disappointment, coming off the particularly high highs of Fallout and Dead Reckoning. The stakes are heightened narratively, with the end of the world being imminent throughout, but you don't often feel the desperation; you're mostly just told about it. And that's one of the things that holds this film back. It's so weighed down in exposition and dialogue scenes that aren't necessarily that much worse than such scenes in the other films in the series, but they're inferior enough that they start to drag. And there's not enough action here, which feels weird to say. There needed to be one more set piece, preferably during the first hour, because this is a long movie and the first hour or more is honestly a bit dull. The funny banter was also much less funny, when they even attempted humor. It's kind of a dour movie, which makes sense with the stakes, but also, I didn't really feel those stakes. So I would've rather just had that usual breezy team chemistry and joke-making.Speaking of stakes and showing things, I would've loved a set piece in a populated area? Or an action scene that felt more alive/crowded/in a place that felt real. In The Final Reckoning, there's an extended one with Cruise alone, one near the end (and on some of the posters for the film) involving some small planes, and then a handful of small shootouts and fist fights. There's nothing that's as big or as exciting as the whole train sequence in Dead Reckoning, and that film had some city action (plus a great car chase) and the whole airport scene. It's fresher in my mind than The Final Reckoning, even though I saw one two years ago and the other two hours ago. There's more tension and a feeling of danger when you can see civilization and bystanders, I think. And with everyone in the world being in danger because of the plot, it was weird to feel like no one (other than the main heroes and villains) was in danger during the action scenes.The finale of this movie is smaller scale, but that sequence is a knockout. It's almost worth the price of admission, but you do have to slog through some dreary stuff beforehand. The end of the world is nigh, but mostly you just hear about it, or some high-ranking government officials discuss things in board/bored rooms (and some of those scenes feel like if they were pushed into territory that was any more over-dramatic, we'd have Dr. Strangelove-esque comedy).The more I think about it, the more I realize this was kind of disappointing, even if I really loved the one big action scene that will, eventually, be the only thing I remember about this. I'm torn between like a 3/5 or a 3.5/5, and think I have to go more toward the former, just because this is too long for something with so little action. It needed to show more of the world, and we needed at least one sequence with more people and things in it. I feel like Dead Reckoning had about two or three times more great action than this, and the same can be said about Fallout. Dead Reckoning was a few minutes shorter, and Fallout was like half an hour shorter. Neither cost as much, but both felt more expensive. More bang for your buck watching those, and fewer bucks spent by the filmmakers to make them. The Final Reckoning feels pretty expensive, but not $300-400 million expensive.They got a little lazy with The Final Reckoning. They didn't get lazy in the couple of particularly flashy scenes, but they needed more big scenes and they shouldn't have had the film feel so empty. Too much telling, not enough showing. The lack of a consistent villain throughout hurt - Gabriel was a compelling presence in Dead Reckoning, but he's not in this one as much, disappearing for long stretches at a time.The Final Reckoning comes alive in parts. The plane stuff is thrilling. 90% of the movie, or maybe even a little more, fluctuates between being a tiny bit disappointing and very disappointing. I guess overall, I'm quite disappointed they couldn't keep the momentum going; these films had just kept getting better, from the second onwards, but no more.This really will be the Final one, I Reckon.

When the credit rolled I had nothing but respect for the makers, for the entire team, not just of this movie but for every movie since MI 1996.Overall, it might not top Mission Impossible Fallout but it will stay equally memorable to me. It did its job well which is to conclude the franchise in a spectacular way, without going over the top with action (think of Fast and Furious franchise).I surely liked it better than Dead Reckoning because there were more of likeable characters rather than annoying characters. It was like a bunch of good people coming together to fight a noble cause, something that was missing in the previous movie. Some people might find some of the scenes being too lengthy but I didn't mind all of the hard work being played a little longer than required. Watching Tom Cruise giving it his all was once again as thrilling as it was 25 (or so) years ago.As the movie said: our lives are the sum of our choices.

Let me tell you, everyone will be googling \"Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene\" a week for now.The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996\\'s Mission: Impossible\\'s own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma.

The realism and authenticity added the rest.Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well.And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it\\'s here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that\\'s not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It\\'s hella great!!In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence.After 150 minutes of absolutely no motorcycles and cars chasing each other, though plenty of Cruise sprinting, the red and yellow old-school biplanes going after each other in South African skies is something that should adequately feed all the ravenous audiences. It\\'s suspenseful, it\\'s engaging, it\\'s REALLY dangerous; though the villainous Gabriel character is still bland and bad, like the previous entry.The diversity, without throwing into our faces what their genders are, is probably the quintessential example of how these things should be done. Hannah Waddingham in charge of aircraft carrier was something that really paid off. I didn\\'t like the \"lady boy\" person wearing that vest and donning horrible hairstyle in that submarine. Angela Bassett seemed a natural as a president and didn\\'t feel forced to assume a masculine aura just because she\\'s a female US President. Thanks to all the brilliant women in the movie to forsake that awful clich√© line \"you don\\'t think a woman can do it\" - you show them subtly rather than preaching non-stop about such superfluous substance like in some Marvel movie.Overall, a decent enough Mission: Impossible movie but a brilliant actioner, nonetheless, given how the series has always fared when compared by Hollywood\\'s standards.

And for me it does not work.Bringing back ground characters back from previous MI movies, who cares?! Tying the entity to what we saw in MI3. Why? We already had the setup in Dead Reckoning? Why make it any more complicated?!None of the epic / surprise set pieces such as the Kremlin bombing in Ghost Protocol are here. It very much needed something in the first 90 minutes, such as a nuke going off. Instead we are just told what the threat is and it goes on and on.No Masks, no Ethan completely surprisingly outsmarting the bad guy. It needed something epic, which I was expecting (Ethan had to outsmart the Entity and be a step ahead according to Luther!) For example Elsa could have surprisingly made it and just faked her death or so (in the party club scene in DR we saw Gabriel knives - I thought Ethan may have swapped them for dummy ones or so, the tools were there to do this).I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one.A real shame.

Clunky exposition, lazy flashbacks, and a nostalgia-soaked checklist of memberberries that feel more obligatory than earned. The pacing limps along for over an hour, weighed down by self-serious dialogue and characters repeating plot points we already know.Even the ending, both in terms of action and its LOTR-style drawn-out goodbyes, feels underwhelming and emotionally hollow.

When Mission: Impossible leans into what it does best-practical stunts and high-octane tension-it soars.

It's long, bloated, and paced like a slog. The exposition dumps are painful-overwritten, unnecessarily complex, and made worse by clunky dialogue that bounces awkwardly between multiple characters and locations mid-scene. It kills momentum and disengages the viewer. The villain is a caricature with little dramatic weight, and despite the runtime, there are surprisingly few action sequences compared to earlier entries. Instead, we get manufactured drama and overwrought tension that never really pays off.The Verdict:\\nThis is still an entertaining ride, but one unlikely to earn many repeat viewings. Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation, and Fallout remain the high watermark of the series. While Final Reckoning lands a jaw-dropping finale, the first half is too bogged down to call this a great send-off.

Despite much-touted and seemingly definitive farewells in X-Men, Harry Potter, or The Lord of the Rings, these properties keep being unearthed and milked until there\\'s nary a cent left. The Mission: Impossible franchise has been surprisingly resilient-consistently delivering increasingly elaborate stunts for Tom Cruise to risk life and limb in. But now, the latest entry is marketed as the final outing for the character of Ethan Hunt.Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) is a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part 1(2023)-already one of the longest-titled films in blockbuster history-which now awkwardly retains its \"Part 1\" subtitle, while its sequel gets a fresh coat of paint. Once again, we\\'re in a world where an all-powerful AI known as The Entity wants to bring about the end of mankind. Having obtained the key to stopping it in the previous film, rogue agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must now travel to the Arctic to locate a sunken Russian submarine containing the source code. The fate of the world (again) rests in his hands. He\\'s joined by old friends like Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Grace (Hayley Atwell), along with former enemies Paris (Pom Klementieff) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis).The Final Reckoning is once again helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has now directed the last four installments of the franchise-and in doing so, helped craft some of its best. But with the pressure of creating a \"finale,\" McQuarrie stumbles into overcomplicated plotting and endless callbacks, losing the franchise\\'s greatest asset: its sense of tightly executed, high-octane fun. Co-writing with Erik Jendresen (also a writer on Part 1), McQuarrie delivers a script that somehow manages to overexplain everything while also making less sense the more you think about it. The dialogue, plotting, and editing feel like they\\'ve been dumbed down to a shocking degree-treating viewers like they\\'re watching the film with one eye on their phone and the other half-closed.As with Dead Reckoning: Part 1, The Final Reckoning doesn\\'t just repeat itself-it hammers you with repetition until it becomes unbearable. Every plot beat is stated, then restated by another character, just to make sure we really, really get it. It\\'s not just redundant-it\\'s patronizing. The film seems genuinely afraid that the audience will forget what\\'s happening if it doesn\\'t spell it out again every five minutes. And the editing doesn\\'t help. The film frequently cuts back to the same shot or moment from seconds earlier, repeating visual cues just in case you momentarily forgot what a submarine or USB key looks like. Final Reckoning feels like a movie edited by someone who assumes you\\'re doomscrolling TikTok mid-scene.This constant handholding means the actual plot doesn\\'t kick into gear until over an hour in. I checked my watch, and characters were still busy either recapping the previous film or rephrasing the very simple premise: \"go to the submarine, stop the AI.\" McQuarrie further complicates things by adding groan-worthy connections to previous films, and having characters make mind-numbingly illogical decisions-just so we can get to a manufactured \"tense\" moment. It\\'s the kind of lazy plotting that feels more Fast & Furious than Mission: Impossible.That said, when The Final Reckoning finally leans into what this series does best-spy thrills and over-the-top action-it briefly remembers how to have fun. The submarine infiltration is a standout sequence, smartly constructed and genuinely suspenseful. It earns its place in the franchise\\'s pantheon of impossible missions. The finale, involving two propeller planes, tries to raise the stakes-but the pacing drags and the climax never quite reaches the adrenaline-pumping heights of past finales. Instead of a crescendo, it feels more like a decent mid-tier set piece that overstays its welcome.Cruise still gives it his all, but the age is starting to show-despite the best efforts of makeup and lighting. The rest of the cast gets sidelined. Pegg and Atwell, who previously offered sharp comic and emotional beats, are reduced to glorified exposition machines. Meanwhile, the film clearly wants to land a big emotional punch between Ethan and Luther, but the writing doesn\\'t quite deliver the weight it\\'s aiming for.In the end, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a disappointment-following the already bloated Dead Reckoning: Part 1. It leans too heavily into endless exposition, condescending repetition, and frenetic editing that\\'s allergic to letting any scene breathe. The lack of trust in the audience drags down the first half. Still, once Ethan finally gets moving, a strong submarine set piece and a decent airborne chase remind us of why we came.

They live it. They breathe it. They are it. And Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is exactly that. Watching The Final Reckoning feels like sitting in a dark room filled with decades of memories, missions, betrayals, and near-death experiences and quietly realizing it might be the last time we see this man sprint toward danger for our entertainment. If this really is the end, then what a journey it has been.This film is not just about espionage, global threats, or saving the world. At its very core, it is a cinematic love letter to Tom Cruise. From the very first shot, the camera practically worships him. And honestly, we do too. He is Mission: Impossible. It\\'s almost as if the film pauses just long enough to let us appreciate the legacy he\\'s built. The real bruises, the real fear in his eyes, the real wind slamming against his face thousands of feet in the air. When they say he does his own stunts, this movie is the ultimate proof of that.There\\'s one sequence, a 20-minute spectacle involving planes, that had us gripping the edge of our seats. Not because it was over-the-top, but because it felt so damn real. The positioning of the cameras, the roaring sound of the engines, the barely visible tremble in Ethan\\'s muscles. All of it screams authenticity. You could feel the gravity. You could feel the weight. And you could tell Cruise was putting every drop of himself into it. It is art through adrenaline.But The Final Reckoning is not perfect. And maybe it was never meant to be.This installment chooses not to waste time diving into backstories or emotional flashbacks. It is mission first, emotions later. And while that does keep the pace laser-focused for the most part, it also comes with a cost. Some fans may feel like the heart, the soul, the \"why should I care?\" moments, are few and far between. At times, it feels like the movie is sprinting only toward its mission goal that it forgets everything else.What we admire, though, is how The Final Reckoning ties itself beautifully to the past. It is not trying to create a brand new mission. It is not throwing a bunch of new characters into the mix. It is solving what Dead Reckoning left behind, and in doing so, it loops itself tightly around the other past six films. It closes loops. It answers questions. It brings emotional closure to threads that have been hanging for years. There\\'s a certain bravery in doing that, of focusing on one mission and choosing not to open new doors just for the sake of future films.And then there\\'s the villain. This antagonist is not just a bad guy, he is intangible. He is near God-like. The stakes are sky-high. It genuinely feels impossible. Like, actually impossible. It puts Ethan and his team in a corner where every second counts. Time is running out. Stake is at all-time high. It is everything we want in a Mission: Impossible film. It dares to make us believe the heroes may not win this time. That someone might not make it out alive.Here\\'s where the main issue lies; this final installment felt very long-winded. It feels like it wants to tell you everything. It seems like it takes itself seriously... way too seriously even. It really does feel like it makes itself looks complex much more than what it is and what it\\'s supposed to be.Some scenes also stretched out very long, like they wanted audience to listen to every word or watch at every action that took place. The pacing is very slow. One scene can go up to 7-8 minutes of what could have been cut to just about 3-4 minutes. It wants it to be very detailed but here\\'s the thing. It\\'s dour. It can be a bit dull. And because of that, some audience may lost interest in the movie. It gives you a lot of expositions that can feel too much for some especially if you\\'re not that invested with the franchise or if you\\'ve forgotten a lot of details from the previous movies.There is also an underwater sequence teased in the trailers that promises something epic. And visually, it delivers. But emotionally and logically? It breaks the very rules this franchise has set up for years. This is the first time it felt like the story needed Cruise to have a bit of CGI help. A bit of plot armor. And that hurts. Because we know he is capable of doing the impossible. But here, it feels like the movie cheated its way to impress the audience. And that matters to us.And yes, the tone itself is gritty. It wants to be raw. It wants to be as realistic as it can. It wants the audience to immerse itself with Ethan Hunt to complete this final mission. Some may get into it. Some others may just feel tedious waiting for the next scene to happen. But here\\'s one thing they forget; with all the grittiness that lies, it forgets to be entertaining for the mass market. The entertainment value in this is lacking for general audience. Everything that\\'s entertaining with Fallout was almost devoid here. What made Fallout great was even with all the grittiness and the grainy tone, its entertainment value is top notch and high octane. It knows its target audience, it has the right balance of action, comedy, drama and romance. But The Final Reckoning forgets that part. Just serious faces doing serious things for almost 3 hours. The film forgets how to have fun. It forgets that people come to be thrilled and entertained. And that lack of balance makes the ride feel a little heavier than it should be.And finally, the ending. Is it satisfying? In some ways, yes. It gives us closure. It gives us enough to walk away with peace. But is it great? That\\'s debatable. It could have used more \\'heart\\'. It could have reached deeper. It ends with the feeling that maybe, just maybe, we\\'re not actually done. That there might be more in the vault. And in today\\'s Hollywood with reboots and sequels era, that\\'s not hard to believe.Verdict: This one takes itself seriously. Way too seriously. It drowns in exposition, stretches scenes beyond their breaking point, and forgets that people came here to feel alive, not just overwhelmed. It forgets to breathe. It forgets to have fun. But maybe that\\'s the point. The Final Reckoning is a heavy, brooding farewell that wants to honor Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise with the gravitas of a cinematic eulogy. Because this feels like the last time we\\'ll see him this raw, this real. His 20-minute plane sequence alone is worth the ticket. If this really is the end, The Final Reckoning isn\\'t flawless but it is fearless. Thank you, Tom Cruise.', 'rating': '6', 'title': \"This Isn't Just a Movie.

A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost.

The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt\\'s biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise\\'s TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with \\'saving cinema\\', so stay on alert for a \\'sky is falling\\' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a \\'simple\\' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it\\'s fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt\\'s mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he\\'s paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt\\'s team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It\\'s nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a \\'making of\\' video that\\'s been available for a while. As movie goers, we\\'ve never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It\\'s been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us.

No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he\\'s as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he\\'s ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise\\'s regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They\\'re tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, \"Hold My Hand.\" It\\'s nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie\\'s \"Take My Breath Away,\" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you\\'re really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that\\'s because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he\\'s trying to show us that there\\'s room for the old and the new to coexist.

It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end.

Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.Did I enjoy the film?

But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.Here is my take and why I think its an \"okay\" film, just not a great one. There really isn\\'t a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It\\'s largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer,\\nyounger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn\\'t have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain\\'s summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn\\'t be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn\\'t aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn\\'t feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That\\'s a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn\\'t think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it\\'s a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don\\'t end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.', 'rating': '6', 'title': 'Not bad, but waayy overrated.'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1745960', 'movie_title': 'Top Gun: Maverick', 'review_body': 'Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past.

AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that\\'s lightning that can\\'t be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the \"Top Gun\" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there\\'s a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it\\'s WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn\\'t all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they\\'re learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie\\'s music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there\\'s virtually no way you wouldn\\'t love this even more. It\\'s absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it\\'s also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can\\'t recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don\\'t wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don\\'t miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don\\'t hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing \"back\" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you\\'d find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don\\'t give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you\\'ve got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn\\'t totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn\\'t know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn\\'t have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this.

It continues the tradition of the series, where it gets better with each film. This one improves on the older films in every aspect. It has pretty much everything: the action, the stunts, the visuals, the twists. It\\'s a thrilling experience where the viewer is kept on their toes at all times.Starting with the action, it is clean, hard-hitting, and it is both directed superbly and brilliantly performed by the actors. This is true when it comes to both the fight scenes and the vehicle scenes. They drive cars, motorcycles, and everything in between throughout the film and it all looks great.The action wouldn\\'t have been as good without its great stunts. I won\\'t ramble on about Tom Cruise for too long but once again, he puts on a remarkable performance. A lot of the stunts are mind-blowing and I have no clue how the man does it, especially now being in his late 50s. Some of these stunts are impossible to describe with words. There is a great amount of documentation of these stunts and they are a must-watch to fully appreciate the film. Cruise risks his life multiple times for the sake of the audience\\'s entertainment and he deserves recognition for it.The visuals are great too, some of the shots in this film were absolutely awe-inspiring. Not only in the way they capture Cruise\\'s stunts but also in the pure beauty of some of the shots. There are plenty that could be named in this review but it is best to watch the film for yourself and see it with your own eyes.The story in \"Fallout\" is great too. The villain is great for starters and the intricate story is enthralling to watch unfold. It sure is complicated, but pay attention and it isn\\'t that hard to follow. There are plenty of great twists in this film and they never feel out of place. The viewer is constantly kept guessing and wondering where the story will go next.If there is something to be thrown at the film it might be either that the film is a bit unrealistic at times or that they repeat some of the old tricks from the older movies. The former is more justified than the latter. Some of the action is a bit over-the-top and unrealistic. It is purely up to personal taste to decide whether that is a negative or not. When it comes to some of the old tricks, they do kind of repeat some elements from the older films, but not to the detriment of the experience. Maybe you\\'ll realize after something happens that you recognize it, but you can never easily see it coming and it is generally done very well.In summary, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a great film. This film is for the viewer looking for great action, incredible stunts, and stunning visuals. It is an absolutely incredible action movie from start to finish.', 'rating': '9', 'title': 'An action masterpiece'}, {'movie_id': 'tt4912910', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout', 'review_body': 'It was from Mission: Impossible 3 (2006) that the franchise began to strike a balance between pace (faster than the first) and history (more elaborate than the previous one). In addition, JJ Abrams\\' debut as a director on the big screen introduced two important secondary characters, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and Benji (Simon Pegg) - he established himself as the second most frequent supporting actor, second only to Luther (Ving Rhames), the single that appears in all the films together with Ethan. After the well-executed Ghost Protocol (2011), commanded by Brad Bird, the series gained a very interesting touch with the arrival of Christopher McQuarrie. As a screenwriter, he smartly took advantage of the mention of the Union at the end of the previous film to develop the Rogue Nation plot (2015), which brought Ethan, Luther and Benji chasing this terrorist organization, headed by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and at the same time, dealing with the risk of dissolution of the IMF as a result of the Ghost Protocol events - this created a hitherto unprecedented sense of continuity between the two films.The title\\'s Fallout has several meanings - among them \\'Side Effect\\', \\'Rest\\' and \\'Radioactive Dust\\'. In the film we have a literal and figurative meaning at the same time. There is a real threat of nuclear bomb and also the consequences of the choices that our protagonist Ethan Hunt made in his life, when the past comes back to haunt him, what remains of all his good deeds. This sixth part of the franchise continues several of the situations established in the previous work, Rogue nation, also directed by Christopher McQuarrie. In addition, the filmmaker takes up other previous ideas, exploring the twists that marked the first and third films, as well as the notion of loyalty to the team members, seen in the third and fourth, and the protection of loved ones, as in the second and in the bedroom. This not only creates thematic unity in the series but also helps to reinforce the protagonist\\'s personality.Even repeating starting points previously seen, such as the rescue of nuclear weapons, the dismantling of secret associations and the search for double agents, there is a new topic to be discussed in the \"Fallout\". Something that was always present in Hunt\\'s story, but that had never been addressed literally: his own humanity. This is the greatest homage that the film pays to the complete saga. After all, how to forget how many times the agent has already put his life, and that of all humanity, in danger to save those he loves. That relay from before, with forgettable characters replacing forgettable characters, no longer exists. Exceptional control by the filmmaker in what he wants for the franchise, in the second film under his command, is exactly what allows Mission: Impossible - Fallout to be an apex of the genre.\\nMcQuarrie tells a story, in the usual conspiratorial molds, being told under a superficial layer. Far from being simplistic, but also far from extreme complexity or wit, what is being told is not very impressive. The motivations for the antagonists follow, in short, the classic recipe, but the central issue is not in the functional story, however, in the exciting narrative, which drives events to another dimension and allows the Fallout to be the great achievement of the genre in which finds. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to characterize the feature film as one of the most energetic American action productions of recent years. By also having control over the script, McQuarrie invents and reinvents the antics related to the iconic twists, filling his project with countless of them, but never too much forcing them. Each turnaround is an impulse, which multiplies our interest and involvement in the film. Cinema is about action, not wanting to be anything more, with clever metaphors or some biblical allegory to show how intellectual McQuarrie is. The impossible happens on the scene, however, we do not discredit what we see, because the feature film, unlike others of the genre, has self-awareness of what it is, thus allowing the suspension of disbelief to be combined with entertainment that only values McQuarrie\\'s work.The screenwriter and director reconstructed the genre cinema with Mission: Impossible - Fallout: the action received more dramatic layers (without plummeting to melodramas or clich√©s); Ethan Hunt was decentralized from the plot despite obviously being the protagonist; women received an importance ranging from the femme fatalle of Vanessa Kirby with her White Widow to the development of the fantastic Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) - who repeats her participation; the exaggerated comic relief gave way to a more restrained Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and without losing his personality; Ving Rhames with his Luther Stickell received much more importance (as it might have happened some time ago); and the villain went from being episodic and one-dimensional to being of rare complexity in action films - so rare that the last one that reached the depth of Solomon Lane (the spectacular Sean Harris) must have been Alan Rickman\\'s Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard, 1988 (30 years ago).McQuarrie, likewise, surrenders to the film with such competence that the action scenes directed by John Woo in 2000 are instantly forgotten. That choreographed movement by Woo gives space to McQuarrie\\'s restless camera, which, even though unstoppable, manages to be very well understood. This same camera, positioned for several counter-plunges (below eye level and facing upwards), magnifies the character of Henry Cavill (the intimidating of so big and strong August Walker) and strengthens the excellent performance of the current Superman. Here, more than ever, we see scenes of visceral struggles, of high physical vigor, impact and realism - the bathroom scene and the final fight on the precipice are the greatest examples - and they do not show that they are choreographed.The action is practically uninterrupted and if, in the end, the reminder is that the film started out slow and then started, it is a problem of perspective. This chapter extrapolates and raises to the maximum everything that has been shown so far. Christopher McQuarie\\'s direction knows how to create magnificent action scenes mixed with tension and a sense of urgency, making the audience emotional, tense, twist and be impressed over the two and twenty hours of footage. Again we have everything and a little more than expected from the series, which improves and challenges itself more and more throughout the franchise. We have scenes of jumping from a plane in the air in a phenomenal sequence plane, chases at extremely high speed involving motorcycles, cars and trucks through the streets of Paris, the whole passage in London (highlighting the rush of Hunt and the jumps between buildings in the hunt for the villain of the production) and, obviously, the scenes in Kashmir that make up the best last act of recent cinema times, combining tension with the rest of the IMF group trying to defuse two nuclear bombs while Hunt stars in a helicopter chase that culminates in a visceral struggle on the edge of a precipice. The film abuses the practical effects and it is difficult to differentiate what has CGI from the real. Beautiful technical work.The most impressive thing is to see how Cruise still avoids the use of stunts in most scenes. Not exactly because of the difficulty of these, which are really difficult without any further obstacles, but because of their age. In one scene, the actor even broke his ankle and went uncut, limping, but firmly on his Ethan\\'s body (and delayed filming later, of course). Cruise is undoubtedly an actor who is never limited to an \"autopilot\". Fly helicopters - and hang from them! -, driving cars at high speed, jumping over buildings and running as if there was no tomorrow, all done in the most realistic way possible, even if we are facing a character who practices impossible acts are some of his most notable feats. This without mentioning the most dramatic part that the actor knows how to conduct in full.Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return and fit the plot very well. Other prominent returns are that of Rebecca Ferguson who returns to deepen his personal dilemmas and his relationship with Hunt, both actors have an enviable chemistry and Sean Harris who returns to give life to the villain of the previous feature, here he keeps talking little, but his ambitions are much clearer and he serves as a \"ladder\" for the real antagonist of the feature. In the new additions the one who steals the show is Henry Cavill in the role of a government agent who is tasked with watching and caring for Hunt. The actor has an enviable physique and if he is not impressed by his performance, he is not to be desired in terms of beating and other action scenes in the feature.With an accelerated and uninterrupted soundtrack composed by Lorne Balfe, referring almost directly to Hans Zimmer, it makes the Fallout clearly result in a bigger Mission: Impossible. The soundtrack that anguishes and carries us on our shoulders throughout the projection, combined with an unbelievable sound design, making us feel every punch delivered and received by Hunt, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is the best film of all the franchise. Technically and emotionally. Mission: Impossible - Fallout wins in a historic process.

Plus, there are no annoying shaky cam, obvious CGI, quick edits, and off-center/close up framing of the action scenes to hide: lazy action choreography/sequences, actors' terrible physicality *cough Scarlet Johanssen's lame Black Widow cough* and/or blatant stunt doubles. Complete viewing immersion and the suspension of disbelief does not get broken once in Fallout for me. I'm not sure if Rebecca Ferguson and Henry Cavill used stunt doubles because that's how great the action stunts are - all perfectly seamless between actors and stunt doubles. My pet peeve when seeing action movies is when the stunts/action are so blatantly done by the stunt doubles *cough Scarlet Johanssen's lame Black Widow cough*. (BTW, convincing action stars Emily Blunt or Rebecca Ferguson would've played a better Black Widow because they have the right physique/stature, athletic physicality, and a great wide range acting chops which would've done justice to the comics Black Widow).Every element of MI: Fallout falls in the spectrum of good to amazing.

Welcome back Ethan Hunt, and the other members of IMF. This is the 6th film in the franchise born (not Bourne) from the classic TV series (1966-73) created by Bruce Geller (credited in each film). Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie returns for this companion piece to his 2015 MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ROGUE NATION, as of course does mega-star Tom Cruise as the aforementioned Ethan Hunt.Hunt\\'s team of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) returns, as does really really bad guy Solomon Lane (a glowering Sean Hayes), and MI6 agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). New to the scene is Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, MAN OF STEEL), a hulking hunk of a man who doesn\\'t share Ethan\\'s belief in brainy strategy. Speaking of strategy, I was a bit tricky in inviting a friend to the screening who is in the midst of a years long boycott of Alec Baldwin movies. Although I felt a fleeting twinge of guilt, I believe the payoff was such that it lessened the impact of deception. Also appearing are Angela Bassett as a CIA toughie, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, and Vanessa Kirby (\"The Crown\") as White Widow.Most fans of this franchise have likely accepted that the stories are overly intricate - this one is unnecessarily jumbled - and they just enjoy the clamorous ride to an ending that typically has something to do with a bomb and saving the world. It\\'s the action and stunts that drive ticket sales, and this one has the most extreme and over-the-top action sequences we\\'ve seen yet. Even though there is a familiarity to some, the stunts are still quite impressive; and yes, Mr. Cruise, now in his mid-50\\'s, still performs his own stunts. This includes the leap between buildings where he actually suffered a broken ankle, shutting down production for a few months. The jump where he was injured is included in the film. And fear not, the Cruise Sprint is in full force on numerous occasions. Sadly, there is also a quick shot of a Ving Rhames jog - nothing but painful to watch.The film opens with a wedding day nightmare, but quickly moves to what the fans want - globetrotting, chase scenes, slick advanced technology and wacky stunts. The streets, bridges and landmarks of Paris are on full and spectacular display, while the chase scenes occur on foot, on motorcycle, in cars, and in helicopters. Crazy stunts include HALO jumping, rock climbing and dangling from an elevator shaft. There is a relentless brawl scene in a men\\'s room where Hunt gets face planted into a porcelain sink and thrown through a wall ... and thanks to the magic of Hollywood, five minutes later, he has nary a scratch and looks as debonair as James Bond ever has. However, it\\'s the final helicopter sequence through the mountains and cliffs of Kashmir that provide the signature moments of the film. Even with the nod to JURASSIC PARK, it\\'s a breathtaking scene.Running nearly 2 ¬Ω hours, this is the longest of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films, and Ethan Hunt remains, along with Maverick in TOP GUN (sequel filming now), the best fit for Tom Cruise the actor and celebrity. Unfortunately the same can\\'t be said for Henry Cavill. He\\'s blessed with extraordinary genes - just not the thespian types. Filled with double and triple and quad crossings, whether you can follow the story or not, only the most stoic would claim you will find this anything less than an adrenaline rush ... should you decide to accept.

Soon Barry contacts General Noriega as a courier for the CIA and is contacted by the Medellin Cartel that wants him to transport drugs to the USA.

It\\'s just that Barry loves to go with the flow and without any intention of getting involved with anything that seems out of his league and this is something each one of us can relate to. He is your usual guy who happens to be a pilot and wants to make some extra cash with every extra mile. So what\\'s wrong with it? Well nothing is wrong when you do it for the right guys, and nothing gets more exciting and dangerous when those right guys turn out to be CIA.What is even more amusing and entertaining to watch is the fact that despite having no choice left but to cooperate with CIA, \"Barry Seal never says no\" to any offer (even if it comes from any drug lord) that helps him maintain his cash flow that obviously was becoming unmanageable for him by every passing day. Although, I must admit that it was quite a fun to watch him trying to manage millions of cash that he had no idea how to spend.You will definitely enjoy watching Tom cruise as Barry Seal who uses CIA to get his end of the bargain (and they thought that they were the only smart guys who live in one of the greatest countries of the world).If you want to go on an adventure trip, go watch this movie and you will understand what Tom Cruise really means when he says, \"I am just a gringo who always delivers\".', 'rating': '7', 'title': 'An Entertaining & Exciting Stuff! - Here is an actor who always (with some exceptions) delivers.'}, {'movie_id': 'tt3532216', 'movie_title': 'American Made', 'review_body': \"American Made was a good watch - the story keeps a good steady momentum, the direction and editing are vibrant and dynamic.

But it stays firmly in the mode of fast-paced 'zany' without ever really digging into emotions, desperation, or any human reflection. Barry Seal as a character remains a breezy, zany blur. Its just that kind of film. I think Cruise has a lot to do with that - his vanity as an actor, having to be seen as either confused- smiley or cool-intense in any given moment limits his courage to do anything else (Born on the Fourth of July was a real anomaly for him in terms of range).

American Made is just as humorous and is also set amidst an invasion of sorts except this movie is a true story. Captain Barry Seal had the adventure of a lifetime before falling prey to a monster of his own doing. But what an adventure it might have been for this man to smuggle contraband into and out of the States.I felt Tom Cruise did a great job portraying the pilot in an extremely light-hearted and funny way. Cruise is known for playing roles that ooze oodles of dare-devilry. But most of those roles are of fictitious characters. For once Tom plays a real man whose daring knew no bounds. Captain Barry Seal was like a real-life Ethan Hunt. Hence I feel casting Cruise as Seal was an extremely appropriate decision and should help in filling Universal Studios Entertainment's coffers.If you were awed after seeing the aerial sequences in Dunkirk, wait until you have seen this film. The planes are subjected to go through some intense acrobatics which will please you. If you were disappointed with Cruise after watching The Mummy, I can assure you that you will heave a sigh of relief after watching this film. The film's story is not only engaging but also witty and hilarious. There are hardly any stagnant moments so the probability of you getting bored is very low.A very ironic thing about American Made is that in 1986 when Barry Seal must have gone through whatever turmoil he did, a young Tom Cruise played a pilot in Top Gun which released that year.

It even had some political figures mentioned as well. The title of the movie also suit the story very nicely. You would understand why it has such title by the end of the film.In the end, you could already guess the conclusion of the movie. Especially if you are a history buff who already knew the story of Barry Seal. There appeared to be various versions of his life story, so I am not sure either whether the one we saw here was the real actual version. But anyway, in term of entertainment, the movie was made into a non boring kind of biographical movie. However, those who were expecting to see Tom Cruise kick a$$ in this movie would probably be disappointed cause this is not that kind of movie. There were some action scenes but this film could not be categorized as action type. There were no very emotional moments as well (which I found rather odd as usually biography movie would have some of those parts).Finally, if you are looking for a good biographical crime movie, this one might be a good option. Though this was not as heavy as other movies in such category, it was still interesting to see Tom Cruise's portrayal of one of the controversial character in US history. It was also directed by Doug Liman who was the director of some good and/or commercially successful movies such as The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Edge of Tomorrow and few others. But for those who are looking for movies with lots of actions by Tom Cruise, better wait for his next Mission: Impossible movies.

I say story-line, but in reality it is one of those docu-drama\\'s, being based on fact. I wonder how much was dramatization as there were some parts where you would ask \"did this sh*t really happen?!\"Would I be inclined to add it to my DVD collection, no.

It\\'s not long before Seal is approached by a CIA agent to do clandestine reconnaissance in South America. It\\'s not long before Seal gets involved in the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia...

Here they bring us (\"Based on a true story\", we are reminded at the beginning of the movie) the story of a TWA pilot turned CIA informant turned drug runner. The movie is divided up in chapters, from \"CIA \\'78\" to \"Colombia \\'80\" and so on. While the subject matter is quite serious and Barry Seal not particularly likable per se, the movie is fast-paced and zany, and is helped tremendously by Tom Cruise\\'s charming and very effective performance. The supporting cast are for me relatively unknowns, including Sara Wright as Barry\\'s wife, and Domhnall Gleeson as the CIA handler. A minus point is the incessant use of hand-held cameras as well as the use of extreme close-ups. Enough already! We get that it is an action movie! There are tons of great song placements in the movie, and when George Harrison\\'s \"Wah Wah\" plays of the closing moments and the end titles, it perfectly captures much of the movie\\'s ebullience.\"American Made\" opened wide this weekend, and I was looking forward to seeing it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (about 20 people in a huge auditorium), much to my surprise. Perhaps strong word-of-mouth can generate a stronger box office performance in theaters. Regardless, this is bound to find a wider audience on VOD and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

It didn't help that Cruise's character doesn't have much of a persona. He likes to fly and has questionable morals (such as being willing to smuggle drugs) but there is not much there beyond that. I think they wanted to show that he loved his family but he made so many questionable decisions that put them at risk that it was hard to like his character. Plus some people have described this as a comedy but it totally lacked any laugh out loud moments or even internal chuckles.I feel like this story could have been better told with more of a cohesive story line, rather than having Cruise montage his way through it all.

While the film was pretty campy and over-the-top, it worked well and resonated with audiences. Fast-forward 18 years and we have a film of the same title - \\'The Mummy\\' - only starring Tom Cruise in the role of Nick Morton, a treasure hunting renegade who stumbles upon a 5,000-year curse.The only problem is, this film is far inferior to the original. Whether it\\'s Cruise\\'s schtick not jiving with the plot, or the lackluster CGI, or the wooden script, it\\'s hard to say. There\\'s really nothing thrilling about \\'Mummy,\\' as everything feels borrowed, used or broken - nothing is shiny and new. Even fresh faces like Jake Johnson and Sofia Boutella aren\\'t enough to up the excitement factor, and vets like Russell Crowe come off as looking to be in need of a paycheck rather than delivering a performance to be happy with. The action sequences are boring, the \"comic relief\" is far from funny and the acting itself is nothing to marvel at.Cruise can usually find a way to make his films at least somewhat entertaining, but he fails here. There is no chemistry between any of the characters, including Nick and his love interest, Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), so the onus is really on Cruise to shoulder everything. In this case, it\\'s an insurmountable task.\\'The Mummy\\' is a half-hearted attempt to revive a franchise that started strong and has since faded, so it\\'s likely it will be put back in a sarcophagus.', 'rating': '4', 'title': \"This 'Mummy' should've remained buried\"}, {'movie_id': 'tt2345759', 'movie_title': 'The Mummy', 'review_body': 'If #TheMummy is supposed to be the beginning of Universal\\'s ambitious Dark Universe that showcases their classic monsters in one big shared cinematic crossover, then they\\'re off to a terrible start.There\\'s probably only a couple of sequences that somewhat thrill, the rest are just a continuous string of one poorly written, poorly acted and poorly executed scene after another. It feels more like sitting in a dentist\\'s waiting room as opposed to rockin\\' on a roller coaster ride. And Tom Cruise is just wrong for this role, a huge case of miscast. Perhaps they should just press the reboot button again.Sofia Boutella plays an evil ancient princess imprisoned in a tomb deep beneath the unforgiving desert. When a couple of treasure hunters and an archaeologist awaken her in our present day, she returns to life to reclaim her destiny while at the same time unleashing unimaginable terrors in this new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters. Co-starring Tom Cruise, Annabelle Wallis, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson, directed by Alex Kurtzman.The concept of what the writers and director Alex Kurtzman is trying to present to us with \"The Mummy\" is nothing new, in fact it\\'s quite predictable, but the biggest problem about it is that along the way from point A to point B, they fill it in with moments that just don\\'t work. And it gets even more frustrating when they bring it up again the second, third and fourth time as if shoving it down our throats would make it better. The jokes fall flat so much so you kinda feel sorry for Jake Johnson who clearly wants to make some effort as this film\\'s comic relief. There are also parts that are just absolutely pointless and unnecessary. The characters including Dr. Jekyll frequently draw conclusions out of their butts. I do think \"The Mummy\" is what happens when the story is forced to serve the visual spectacle instead of the other way around. That said, rising star Sofia Boutella is a marvelous choice, she exudes that thirst for power effortlessly in addition to being incredibly seductive.But of course, just as expected, instead of it being a movie about Sofia Boutella\\'s The Mummy, it becomes all about Tom Cruise, who as I said earlier is just awfully wrong for this role. I understand that the studios probably think that banking on a A-lister would translate into box office results, but fact of the matter is outside \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise, Cruise just doesn\\'t fit anywhere else anymore. The character that he plays here is is a thieving treasure hunter, much like Nathan Drake from \"Uncharted\" games, but all you see on the screen instead is special agent Ethan Hunt desperately trying to be someone he\\'s not.

I honestly don\\'t think it\\'s as bad. This was supposed to be a new trilogy series that Universal was making called the Dark Universe, and they were remaking all the original Universal horror movies-The Mummy, Frankenstein, The Wolfman, and Dracula. I\\'m honestly more disappointed because of the bad reception this got that they shut that down.I definitely think Tom Cruise was not exactly the right pick for the leading actor in this movie, though. Not saying he wasn\\'t terrible, but all I could think about was it feeling like a Mission Impossible movie.The one thing about this movie I would have loved to see more of was Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; he was fantastic!To wrap things up, personally, this is nowhere near as good as the Brendan Fraser remake, and everybody knows that, but I certainly don\\'t think this movie deserved all the criticism it got.\"', 'rating': '5', 'title': 'Not as bad as people made it out to be.'}, {'movie_id': 'tt2345759', 'movie_title': 'The Mummy', 'review_body': '\"The Mummy\" is the first movie in what Universal Studios wants to call their \"Dark Universe.\" Yeah, that\\'s right. Those re-shoots that 2014\\'s \"Dracula Untold\" went through to tie into a Dark Universe; those don\\'t matter now. That 2010 Benicio del Toro \"Wolfman\" movie; also doesn\\'t matter. In a world where Universes are becoming more and more of a thing, Universal seems determined not to let this monster mash-up of The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde and more slip through their fingers. And they\\'re also not skimping out on finding A-list talent to help sell the whole thing. So far we\\'ve heard Johnny Depp, The Rock, and Javier Bardem\\'s names being thrown into the mix, plus Russell Crowe is already here as Dr. Jekyll. That last one I think is really cool by the way because while so many others have been portrayed by the likes of Gary Oldman and Jack Nicholson\\'s, Jekyll\\'s best portrayal in the past 20+ years has been ugh\\x85.David Hasselhoff. But now let\\'s talk about \"The Mummy\", specifically that old trilogy with Brendan Fraser. There\\'s no doubt director Stephen Sommers lucked out with that first film and there\\'s also little doubt Universal wants to move away from that overall cheesiness here. The question is can they still go serious but also have fun at the same time?And say what you will about Sommers; the guy was a C-grade filmmaker who got a kick out of a cheap thrill but at least you could say he committed to it. This new Mummy is just a wrong-headed disaster. The set-up is pretty much the same as the older Mummy film although here it\\'s a woman played by \"Kingsman\\'s\" Sofia Boutella. She\\'s Ahmanet, an Egyptian Princess who wanted power, sold out to some powerful entity for eternal life, and paid for it by getting entombed.Universal of course is also putting it\\'s faith in Tom Cruise, who plays an Army Vet prone towards treasure hunting. He and several others find Ahmanet\\'s sarcophygus but while bringing it back to be examined, the plane goes down over London and a bunch of strange things happen that they learn can\\'t just be coincidence. This is Cruise just being Cruise here. He gets to run around a lot doing his \"intense face\" all while an attractive woman half his age is along with him for the sexual interplay (more on her in a moment). Yeah, there\\'s discussion about his character growing something of a conscience as this goes on but it\\'s pretty perfunctory.Plus having the Mummy be a woman after Cruise\\'s body so she could plant her demon God inside of him and they can reign as King and Queen; this seems more like it falls into being of one of Cruise\\'s aging vanity projects than on acting skill. Boutella gets very little to do otherwise but try and be seductive while waving her hands in a threatening manner. Otherwise auto-tune does the rest. The Cruise character\\'s love interest is an archaeologist played by Annabelle Wallis who looks like she just stepped out from a Paris fashion show into an archaeological dig. Did I believe her as an archaeologist? No. Did I believe she could spell it? Sure. Either way, it doesn\\'t matter. What does is that she and Cruise are DOA in their scenes together. No character makes much impression here, including Crowe\\'s Dr. Jekyll who\\'s maybe in the film for 20 minutes to explain stuff so simplistic, silly, and predictable that it hardly needs explaining at all before the film rushes through his particular ailment. For some reason screenwriters David Koepp and Christopher McQuarrie think more explanation is still warranted though and in that they couldn\\'t be more wrong. For something trying to feel new, it\\'s remarkably easy to tell where all this is going. Their biggest crime is what they do to New Girl\\'s Jake Johnson, a funny actor who they turn into the Dark Universe\\'s version of Jar Jar Binks in only five minutes. He comes in and out of the film at really odd intervals, either screaming dialogue in the hope of making it funny or giving us yet more exposition we don\\'t really need. Add to that first time action director Alex Kurtzman is a disaster. The action sequences look haphazardly thrown together, just cartoonish and unbelievable, while a spoiler I won\\'t give away about the Tom Cruise character makes them even harder to give a crap about anyway. The fights are stiff and uninteresting, and the special effects are either forgettable or look just as hokey as they did in the Brendan Fraser movies. The plane sequence we saw in the trailer looks pretty decent but hey, you\\'ve already seen the most decent thing in the movie, why pay to see the rest. Overall this is not just a bad film, but a film that has no idea what it even is. It wants to resurrect classic monsters, but isn\\'t the least bit scary. It wants to take it in original directions, but winds up being an ultra-serious, dull version of the 1999 film. It\\'s silly but not funny, it\\'s a lot of commotion but no excitement, it\\'s a Mummy movie that if the ending of this can even be believed, thinks it\\'s something totally different.

With the 1932 original and the fun but lazy 1999 remake and anything in between, we pretty much got it. It can be scary or it can be action packed as it seems Hollywood has left there to be no in between for this type of film. Unfortunately neither of those extremes apply to this one. The Mummy is a pandering and very meager attempt at cashing in on a potential franchise. It's sad to watch because it feels like the studio made this. This doesn't feel organic in any way, shape or form and relies on CGI filled action sequences, Tom Cruise, and cheap scares that end up being unintentionally funny to progress the story. None of which comes off the way it should.The story is absolute crap to put it as lightly as I can. It is plotted so on-the-nose that you can't have anything left up to your imagination except for some scenes of violence that may have been too much for a PG-13. Outside of that, everything is spoon fed to us as the audience. Instead of making you feel like you can keep up, the movie treats its audience like we are stupid and still expects us to continue watching. Honestly, I almost walked out at certain points, it got that bad. Especially during the scenes with Crowe's Jekyll, which are so heavily plot oriented that you can't get a feel for his character and when you get the chance to, it fails, crashes and burns.The cast is surprisingly strong on paper but director Alex Kurtzman fails to utilize them in roles that best suit them. Tom Cruise is really the only cast member that fits the part which, when considering what genre we're talking about here, is a horrible thing. Courtney B Vance, who delivered an awards caliber performance in American Crime Story, is watered down to nothing more than a mere walk on role. Russell Crowe is so obviously doing the film for the paycheck, it feels like he isn't even acting and he is just reading queue cards. As a fan of the cast and the 1932 original, I was left completely disappointed by everyone here. Director Alex Kurtzman, who went from directing a small indie to all of a sudden directing this big bombastic action summer blockbuster, feels out of his element here and misses the beats of a good action movie and completely neglects everything that could make a great horror film.

There were some flaws, which I will mention later, but first the strong points: \"The Monster Always Dies\". One big structural problem with monster movies is the lack of suspense. In the end, the monster is always vanquished. Any suspense revolves around the hero discovering the monster\\'s \\'fatal weakness\\' just in time to save the heroine. In some cases, as with the 1999 Mummy remake, the resolution is telegraphed so early and so strongly that you grow board waiting for Brendon Frasier to wade through all the special-effect laden cliff hangers to finally win the day.This remake handles the problem in a very creative and unexpected way by first making the monster venerable almost from the start and then secondly by introducing another antagonist who turns out to be equally threatening to the hero. This builds suspense as the protagonist is threatened from multiple sides.Ultimately all this climaxes in a completely unexpected ending that I honestly did not see coming; something really unique for a monster film. It may, in fact, be this ending that contributes to the negative reviews since strictly speaking it violates the hallowed monster flick formula most people have come to expect.\"Damsel in Distress\". Another tiring issue with monster films is the obligation to service the inevitable damsel-in-distress theme. Again, Mummy 2017 takes a unique approach by making Tom Cruise and Annabelle Wallis effectively co-equals protagonists. Sometimes she saves him, sometimes he saves her, often with a good deal of humor in the role reversal.All-in-all a movie worth seeing, but of course there were some flaws. Character development is kept to a minimum; only enough to service the plot line. This contrasts with the 1999 Mummy which excelled in wonderfully interesting characters who, unfortunately, were deployed in the service of a mundane and predictable plot. Other flaws include under use of Jake Johnston as the comic relief and a serviceable but uninspiring performance by the heroine Wallis.

This is a re-imagining of Mummy's Hand (1940) that started the Mummy series of movies but with a whole new agenda.

There are elements reminiscent of An American Werewolf in London (1981) and Lifeforce (1985) that forge this version of the Mummy and Russell Crowe's Dr Jekyll makes his glorified entrance half way through to remind you this is a shared monster universe so expect more of the same.Quite simply you either like this sort of stuff or you don't, if you listen to critics they'll convince you this is the worst movie ever made, it's not. It's actually really good fun and nothing more, it won't suddenly change your life and have you buying movie merchandise like a Star Wars film or Marvel franchise flick but it will entertain you if you're not already going into the cinema armed with a critical gun ready to shoot it down for daring to star Tom Cruise like the average Hollywood critic and their anti-Tom Cruise agenda.\", 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Critics be damned!'}, {'movie_id': 'tt2345759', 'movie_title': 'The Mummy', 'review_body': 'Heading out of the theater I was dissapointed to say the least....Of course Tom Cruise killed it as an actor in this film.\\nBut the story is Boring, it doesn\\'t have the same feel as the 1999 and 2001 one and it has a pretty dull ending.\\nAlot of people may enjoy it and I get that but for me it was just a \"Whatever\" movie.\\nIf you want a good movie which entertains you I recommend staying away from this and choosing another Movie.\\nOverall pretty poor start to Universals \"Dark Universe\".', 'rating': '5', 'title': 'Dissapointing'}, {'movie_id': 'tt2345759', 'movie_title': 'The Mummy', 'review_body': 'I liked the movie and seriously feel that this movie doesn\\'t deserve all the hate it is getting.

      "Scraping reviews for movie: Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (tt3393786)\n",
      "[{'movie_id': 'tt3393786', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', 'review_body': 'I\\'m a big fan of Tom Cruise. He is a real old-fashioned film star, generous with his fans on the red carpet and with real star power at the box office. And I can happily sit down in front of just about any one of his DVD\\'s time and time again and still enjoy it. Unlike many critics, I even enjoyed his last outing as Jack Reacher.Unfortunately, and it pains me to say this but, his latest outing - \"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back\" - is a bit dull.Lee Child\\'s Reacher has many years before turned his back on his military past and wanders the country as a drifter righting wrongs outside of the law. In this film, his military past again makes a major (\"No, ex-Major\") intrusion into his life. Potential love interest Major Susan Turner (Colbie Smulders, from the \"Avengers\" world) is arrested on trumped-up espionage charges and Cruise sets out to clear her name. Along the way he accidentally (and rather too conveniently for the plot) discovers that a paternity suit has been filed against him and Reacher confronts the rebellious and light-fingered teenager Samantha (Danika Yarosh, aged 18 playing 15).Unfortunately the big-cheeses involved in the international arms skulduggery are determined to tie up each and every loose end in their intrigue, and that includes Reacher, Turner and young Samantha by association. Needless to say, the villains - led by a one-man killing machine (Patrick Heusinger) - haven\\'t counted on Reacher\\'s \\'particular set of skills\\'.My problem with the film (after an entertaining opening) is that the screenplay lumbers from standard thriller set-piece to standard thriller set-piece in a highly predictable way. It\\'s as if the scripts from 20 different films have been stuck in a blender. Shadowy arms dealing shenanigans: check; Cute teenager in peril: check; Gun fight on a dockside: check; Rooftop chase: check.Are all the individual set-pieces decently done? Yes, sure. But the combination of these bits of action tapas really don\\'t add up to a satisfying meal. The story arc is almost non-existent as there is no suspense in the \\'investigation\\': the plot is all pretty well laid out for you. Where there is some fun to be had is in the play-off between the born- leader Reacher and the born-leader Turner, both trying to be top-dog in the decision making. The romantic connection between the leads seems almost plausible despite their 20 (TWENTY!) year age difference: this is more down to how incredibly good Cruise still looks at age 54 (damn him!). Turner makes a good female role-model right up to the point where there is a confrontation in a hotel room and Turner backs down: despite Cruise being the \"hero\" it would have been nice for female equality for this face-off to have gone the other way.The director is Edward Zwick, who helmed Cruise\\'s more interesting movie \"The Last Samurai\".The trailer started off well and then progressed into general mediocrity. Unfortunately - for me at least - the film lived up to the trailer. Watchable, but not memorable.(Agree? Disagree?

Thanks.)', 'rating': '6', 'title': 'OK... just OK'}, {'movie_id': 'tt3393786', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', 'review_body': 'While the trailer gives too many of the best scenes away (as do seemingly most Hollywood trailers of late), the second entry in the Jack Reacher franchise fails in it\\'s attempt to capitalize on the momentum of the original. With the titular character ably portrayed by Tom Cruise as the quintessential and confident bad-ass, the surrounding cast and paint-by-numbers story-line struggle around his nucleus to present a believable and involving action flick.One of the issues that plagues the franchise is that the source material portrays Reacher as 6\\'5\" tall at a beefy 250 lbs, capable of taking on 4-5 attackers at a time. Cruise is in great shape and appears at least 10 years younger than his actual age but even with strategic camera angles, at 5\\'7\", it is fairly obvious that he is physically outmatched when surrounded by 4 of his assailants. Yet much ass is kicked with relative ease. This affects the realism meter as the film progresses.Another issue is the somewhat stilted dialogue and a few \"Oh, come on, that would never happen!\" moments that elicited a few unintended laughs from other audience members during the viewing I attended.The supporting cast do their part in workman-like fashion and some of the dialogue between Cruise\\'s Reacher and Co-star Cobie Smulders\\' Turner entertains and engages as they argue while being simultaneously attracted to one another. Rounding out the cast as the chief antagonist, Patrick Heusinger is an effective (if somewhat clich√©d) ex- Special Forces Psychopath who hunts Reacher throughout the film.It\\'s unclear at this point whether there will be a third film instalment but based on early box office returns, a sequel is likely. I hope they can take the best elements from the first film which had better fight scenes, less stilted dialogue and fewer formulaic plot devices. Seeing as the Jack Reacher Book series is currently at 21 novels, there should be a worthy successor in the Lee Child-penned Canon to put the film franchise back in good stead the next time around.

I thought Cruise carried it off well.So I was really looking forward to this next instalment . . . and what a disappointment.The difference between the Reacher stories and other so called anti-hero stories is the realism that Lee Child brought to them. For example, none of those long slugging punch ups, Lee Child made it clear that a single punch would suffice and if not delivered correctly, then there was a danger of broken hands etc. And they followed this ethos in the first Reacher movie. But in this latest offering there was just slugging match after slugging match after slugging match, with nothing to show for it other than a cut above Reacher\\'s eye. Where\\'s the bruising and swelling? I\\'m sure he got smashed on the arm by a pipe, but there\\'s nothing to show for it the next day when he\\'s wearing his t-shirt.On top of that, there\\'s a hell of a lot of running throughout the movie - I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t run to the toilet. This, with the camera work and editing had a way of making the movie feel rushed. Finally, the script had one of the clever wit in the books.All in all a disappointing follow up. Was it the Director? I think so.', 'rating': None, 'title': 'Huge disappointment'}, {'movie_id': 'tt3393786', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', 'review_body': \"Never Go Back, indeed. I'm reviewing this long after seeing it in the theater and I haven't seen it since despite its availability on Netflix, Hulu, Prime. The disappointment I felt then is still palpable today, especially after recently re-watching the first film.There is little difference between the first and second films in terms of production level, casting, story line, etc. Yet it's the collective of many small differences and attention to detail that makes one film great and the other a dud. I gave this one a 6 because it satisfies fundamental aspects of an action film, and those who rated the sequel higher than 6 or liked it, consistently to gravitated to that point. However, the first film more than satisfies all that too, but then outshines the sequel in every other way, making it a complete film in my opinion. This sequel falls flat in all those other aspects.I think this film suffers very specifically from two problems - its comparison to the first film and its director. McQuarrie, who directed the first, is known more for his writing resume and has limited directing time, yet seems to understand the concept of satisfying action film fans while maintaining the continuity of a good overall film. Despite his short director resume, he has been consistent in action films.In contrast, Zwick, who directed the sequel, has an Oscar-sprinkled director resume, but is known for drama epics. It seems clear to me that there was a shortsighted agenda by producers to change the direction of the feel, politics, rhetoric or something, but it was a bad idea. Jason Bourne, which came out the same year, had the same problem even though is had the same director as previous sequels. That's why I think it is an agenda thing from the producers.Sequels tend to not be as good as the first, but usually because producers shamefully try to maximize capitalization on the success of the first film by skimping on big details like the director, the script and top actors in the followup film. However, Zwick and Greengrass wouldn't be cheap, plus top actors are still there and production levels alone keep the budgets high. Yet the first films in Reacher and Bourne still stand out so much more. Why? Attention to detail. Like a band's first album - they simply seemed to be trying to nail the small details in addition to the big ones.Producers of Reacher and Bourne either don't understand why the first films were good, or don't care. I lean toward the latter. They only want your money and their agenda pushed. They don't care about longevity. Dollars can be found in the next fad.Many reviewers have pointed out some of these flaws with the second film that were not in the first, or not as bad. Forced dialogue, implausible action scenes, all the good scenes in the trailer, hokey drama, flat/weak characters, cliche settings, and so on. I'll add these to it: The opening sequence was the only part of the sequel that seemed like the first film. I think that was strategic. If some people knew better, they'd never had gone in the first place. Next, Cruise didn't seem interested the entire film. He appeared to be going though the motions in many scenes, while he seemed to relish in the character of the first film. Smulders should've been a perfect fit for her role, yet her performance wasn't half as good as Rosamund Pike in the first film. Outside of Cruise and Smulders, there were no other memorable performances or characters. The first film had dozens of well-thought out and well-performed characters. Every actor was fitting and at least up to par in the first Reacher. I think its worst performance was the local detective, and he at least did okay. No other secondary role in the sequel reached his level. There was NOBODY like Jenkins, Courtney, Herzog or Duvall in the 2nd film and these were big names playing secondary roles in the first Reacher. But even the next level roles like the supposed gunman, the thugs at the bar and the victims on the river were well-played and fitting compared to just about everyone in the sequel. Even the brief scene by the auto store manager in the first film was better performed and more memorable than the roles of the entire sequel.Finally, the action scenes in both films can be criticized as unrealistic, and the final fight scene in the first film was one of the few things I didn't like in that one. But at least everything in the first film was plausible compared to the sequel. As one reviewer noted, the sequel stepped back into the cliches of the 90s for much of the action scenes. Maybe Zwick didn't know any better and they rushed through the details believing or hoping it would pass, just like the recent Jason Bourne film. It's as if they believe most people are dumb enough to believe some very stupid things (like remotely accessing CCTV cameras). Maybe people are that naive or simply that eager for ANY entertainment, but the IMDB ratings at least slightly show otherwise. If the direction of Reacher continues this way, I won't even consider going to the next one. I'd need some significant reassurances.\", 'rating': '6', 'title': 'Wrong Direction'}, {'movie_id': 'tt3393786', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', 'review_body': 'Movie Street V.3 # 190Tom Cruise is back with his new action thriller \"Never Go Back\".

The bad guys are willing to kill as many people as needed but this is the kind of movie where they always come up a little short ending with a hand-to-hand fight.

Robbie K here reviewing Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, which promises to have some mystery, action, and comedy to entertain us. But will Hollywood deliver on its promise, or will we get another lackluster sequel from the generic mold?LIKES:\\x95 Fast Pace \\x95 Comedic Timing \\x95 Solid castingIn my experience, crime stories tend to drag out a bit before getting to the juicy drama and violence. While this film is a little slow and convoluted at the beginning it does cut through most of the boring fat to get to the action packed meat. The pace continues to pick up through the movie, as constant pursuit from the enemy keeps our small band on their toes throughout the country. While some of the slower character building moments are integrated into the intense game of hide, seek, and run, they are often short, entertaining sequences that are there to set up for the impending \"excitement\". Rest assured, Reacher\\'s latest journey connects the dots in rapid succession to get you to the answers as quickly as possible. And like the last installment, you might be hoping for some witty comedy to help relieve the tension of the constant chase. Good news, the writers adapted the book to provide Reacher\\'s famous dry humor. For those who don\\'t know, this movie\\'s style isn\\'t slapstick and stupid one- liners to be endlessly quoted. Instead Reacher\\'s comedy is dry where timing is the main punch line rather than mindless babbling. Seeing Cruise react to some of the scenarios or deliver a sarcastically flat response were the funniest components of the film. I felt the comedy was well integrated into the tale and not abused to keep the laughs as fresh as possible. Of course the comedy and story would be nothing without a good cast, and Reacher has a great lineup to keep you entertained. All of the cast feels like a solid military crime family, each playing that stereotypical, no nonsense attitude cinematic soldiers seem to have. While not as tall as book Reacher, Cruise\\'s rogue nature mixes well with Smulders modern age warrior woman to craft a realistic, crime solving MP duo. Ms. Yarosh as the edgy teenager from a broken home also played her part well and added a twist that both worked and annoyed me at times. And as for the hunter, Heusinger played him well but I don\\'t think the character direction worked for me (more on that later). Still the cast overall make you feel part of a government conspiracy, which gets a plus in my book. DISLIKES: \\x95 Action is short lived \\x95 Annoying character tendencies \\x95 Little mystery and suspenseThe trailers paint for action, but sadly that action has been greatly reduced to Reacher being in small scuffles that usually detail some poor extra getting knocked unconscious in a single punch. Occasionally you get some gun play involved and a chase scene displaying Cruise\\'s agility, but even this lackluster at times. While a former veteran appreciated the realistic battles, I was hoping for a little more excitement and tension to grace the screen. This nearly happened at the end, but that scene crossed into a drawn out, ridiculous torture that while justified, did little but make my eyes roll. While the action scenes may have been annoying at times, there were a few characters who ground my gears. Samantha in particular was an irritation, as her portrayal of an edgy teenager, whining about everything did little to entertain me. Samantha\\'s arrogance can be entertaining at times (and was important for character development), but there were a good number of shots that had me hoping Reacher would slap some sense into her. And as for the hunter, well he doesn\\'t win the award for scariest motive, merely a mercenary with delusions of grandeur to feed his obsession. His skills are certainly impressive, but his drive is lacking and kind of stupid. Yet the biggest disappointment had to be the lack of mystery and suspense in this movie. In the first installment Reacher had to dig deep to find the perpetrator by pushing his skills to the limit and using ingenuity. In this film though, the quest was almost too easy for Reacher, with all the pieces falling to conveniently into place that is uncharacteristic of a crime thriller. The source of the corruption was sloppily revealed in the form of pointless character I cared little about and lacked the twist of the original. Of course the surprise isn\\'t helped by obvious foreshadowing introduced in what would be perceived as unnecessary scenes.THE VERDICT:Overall Reacher\\'s latest adventure is a more diluted version of its predecessor. For me the cast is the strongest aspect in this fast paced adventure who will set the stage for the adventure. However, the lack of a challenging mystery was a major disappointment that didn\\'t have the action to make up for it.

Both films are based on novels, written by Lee Child, about a former US Military Police Corps major, named Jack Reacher, that now takes on odd jobs as a vigilante drifter. In this film Reacher is framed, and trying to uncover a giant government conspiracy; with the help of a current military major, that's also been framed and now a fugitive from the law. The movie costars Cobie Smulders, Danika Yarosh, Patrick Heusinger, Aldis Hodge, Holt McCallany and Robert Knepper. It was directed by Edward Zwick (who also teamed with Cruise on 2003's 'THE LAST SAMURAI'), and it was written by Richard Wenk, Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's only been a modest hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as much as the original (if not more).After busting a human trafficking ring, Jack Reacher (Cruise) returns to the Military Police Corps headquarters, he used to work at, in order to meet Major Susan Turner (Smulders); who he has possible romantic feelings for. Once there Jack learns that Turner has been arrested for espionage. Despite the fact that she asked him not to get involved, Reacher begins to investigate the crimes she's accused of. In the process he becomes framed as well, and the two both go on the run from the law together; while trying to clear their names. Jack also learns that he might possibly have a 15- year-old daughter (Yarosh), who also becomes involved in the conspiracy. I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie, I found it to be highly entertaining. It does lose it's way, a little bit in the middle, but for the most part it's a solid action thriller. I love the Jack Reacher character, and Cruise's conviction to the role is impressive. I also think it's awesome that the film has a really strong heroine character as well, and the relationship between her and Reacher is never sexual (or overly romantic). It's just a really well made movie, despite the fact that it drags just a little.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30\", 'rating': '8', 'title': \"I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie!\"}, {'movie_id': 'tt3393786', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', 'review_body': 'A lean, no-frills action thriller that leans into Tom Cruise\\'s signature grit, Never Go Back delivers exactly what fans expect: bone-crunching hand-to-hand combat, high-octane chases, and a conspiracy that\\'s equal parts predictable and entertaining.

Among them, Mission: Impossible 5 - Rogue Nation stands out as an unyielding spectacle, enthralling the audience with its captivating sequences from start to finish. Both MI 4 and MI 5 commence with unparalleled intensity, leaving the viewers perched on the edge of their seats right from the opening moments. Mere minutes into the film, we are graced with Ethan Hunt's breathtaking stunt, catapulting us into a gripping and superbly crafted plot.As I indulged in Rogue Nation in the year 2023, fortune smiled upon me, for I discovered the presence of Alexei, renowned for his role in Stranger Things, adding an unexpected but welcome charm to the cinematic experience.The film's stunning visuals and meticulous planning render it a true cinematic gem. The choreographed stunts, impeccable action sequences, and masterfully timed performances, along with exceptional direction and a compelling script, beckon one to revisit this cinematic triumph multiple times. MI Rogue Nation proudly claims its place as one of the paramount offerings in the secret service genre, trailing only behind its predecessors, Ghost Protocol and Fallout.Rebecca Ferguson, with her unparalleled allure and cunning prowess, undoubtedly stole the show. Her scenes were nothing short of extraordinary, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's memory. Although Tom Cruise, as the unwavering protagonist, carried the film to its triumphant conclusion with his trademark brilliance, Rebecca's performance was undeniably a cut above the rest. Simon Pegg, reminiscent of his role in the fourth installment, brought a delightful sense of levity and camaraderie to the series, enriching the overall experience. Jeremy Renner, too, delivered a powerful and compelling portrayal, further adding depth to the ensemble cast.Additionally, the film's background music played an instrumental role in maintaining an immersive atmosphere, keeping the audience thoroughly engaged throughout the thrilling action. The cinematography and action sequences showcased technical brilliance of the highest order. However, in my humble estimation, I consider it the third best installment in the Mission: Impossible series.Emphatically carrying the torch of the MI legacy, this film is an absolute must-watch for aficionados of adrenaline-pumping action and devoted Tom Cruise fans alike. Personally, I found myself thoroughly engrossed, scarcely able to identify any lackluster moments throughout the duration of the film, and thus, I grant it a resounding score of 8, which speaks volumes about its exceptional quality and entertainment value.\", 'rating': '8', 'title': '\"Mission: Impossible 5 - Rogue Nation: An Adrenaline-Pumping Spectacle That Doesn\\'t Disappoint!\"'}, {'movie_id': 'tt2381249', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation', 'review_body': \"I love how it builds upon the event of the previous one and introduces a lot personal stakes for the team, especially with the character of Benji towards the end.

You'd think he'd just kill her by now.Speaking of Lane, I like him. He's no Philip Seymour Hoffman, but Sean Harris is still one of the most interesting MI villains if solely for the choices he makes with his performance.Not much else say other than it's a badass action movie and probably the entry where I most care about the story.

It's exciting, slick, cool and fun, but this series, most of all in this film, has got an amazingly inexhaustible energy to it that makes it so brilliant.Let's start, then, with the main attraction of this film: the action. Simply, it's stunning. There are five separate big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film.Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever).On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world.

The latest instalment 'Rogue Nation' is on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there is a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure is somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' has enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.Visually, 'Rogue Nation' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool', perhaps the most audacious of all five films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.With the exception of a few choppy combat scenes, big emphasis on the few, the action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.'Rogue Nation's' script is sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go. There is an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go) worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, a big claim and to some hyperbolic but it felt that way to me and it is grand praise indeed.Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows a knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris is an intimidatingly menacing villain, one of the best written villains of the series, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome.

I guess my expectations for action thrillers centering on secret agents were set too high because I saw the 'Bourne' trilogy and Daniel Craig's James Bond films first. The first three 'MI' films all seemed a little too slow, cheesy or convoluted on my first viewing. The fourth one was pretty good, even if the story does feel a little forgettableSo, where does that bring me for the fifth entry of the franchise? My expectations were set at average around this time, despite all the good word-of-mouth I've been hearing. However, it wouldn't have mattered if my expectations were set around the same level for the latest 'Bourne' or James Bond film (very high) ‚Äì 'MI:5' blew everything I'd expected from it and then some! Where to begin? The film possible contains the biggest, and possibly best, story out if all the other installments.

It may seem like a lot, but the script is really well structured and paced. Even though the film does take a few liberties with how some of its characters will ultimately act in the end, the plot isn't nearly as predictable as one would make it out to be. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie also manages to squeeze in some surprisingly silly moments at the most random of moments.The action scenes in this film are also some of the best in this franchise. Soon after showing Ethan Hunt take off on the side of an airbus, the film kicks it into overdrive and delivers an adrenaline rush packed with REALLY well done car chases, okay hand-to-hand combat scenes (they're kind of choppy), and ONE very suspenseful, pulse-pounding scene involving multiple snipers. McQuarrie's direction over the editing of these sequences is incredibly nuanced ‚Äì so much so that I found myself repeatedly leaning over the edge of my seat with excitement.People who weren't fans of the cheese factor (forced romances, convenient gadgets, and the overuse of face masks) of the previous films would be glad to know that it's been done away with in this film. And for people fearing that this is a film that takes itself too seriously, let me be one of the first to say: it doesn't. One may draw parallels between the events that have happened in this film to some of the recent events in our world, but I see it as a clever way for the franchise to keep up with our times.'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is without a doubt one of the most exciting films I've had the pleasure of experiencing this year.

Storyline with nice twists and pretty good for an action movie, though watching Ghost Protocol helps getting to know the IMF crew (there's no introduction this time around).**spoiler-free**Rogue Nation, like the latest movies in the franchise and others in the spy/action genre, starts with a small crew, with little support, against huge odds, having to deal with challenges that seem impossible (no pun intended). What makes Rogue Nation better than most is that it makes it all plausible without super-human characters, crazy gizmos (except one that I shaw not mention, but it is not overused like in M:I II), and brilliantly made down-to-earth action sequences. The latest 007 movies are following the same ideals, but M:I has made a solid choice of supporting actors (specially Simon Pegg) that add a subtle layer of comedy and improvisation, which helps a lot into building some suspense in the audience - it feels like as if they are as clueless as we are of what is going to happen.Another great aspect that sets this moving apart are the terrific action sequences which are paired with outstanding sound effects and music score (without spoiling, there is an entire action sequence that plays with this very aspect). Was lucky enough to watch a pre-screening on IMAX, and strongly recommend watching it on IMAX or a theater with a good audio setup. The storyline, while not hard to follow, benefits from having watched at least Ghost Protocol, since key characters are back and lack some introduction, and the story somewhat picks from what took place in the last instance. Much like Ghost Protocol, the storyline packs some interesting twists and doesn't seem obvious - even though we all know that the good guys win, Rogue Nation adds some shady characters which are not as black and white, making for some interesting development.Overall a highly entertaining movie, packed with stunning action sequences and a storyline that is well thought-out and manages to keep the audience hooked until the end.

That\\'s the first of too many, and you wouldn\\'t care less of the logic behind such impossible knockout stunt demonstrations, because once the momentum crashes past the speedometer\\'s limit, there\\'s no other choice left but to get consumed by the electrifying influx of near-impossible action setpieces.

There\\'s much to say about how inconsistent and illogical some of the narrative choices that the screenwritersn took are, but they get overshadowed by the more relevant, and on this case, more effectively utilized, high-tension action extravaganza.One can inevitably notice how Cruise has aged through the franchise\\'s almost two-decade history.

I actually enjoyed this one much more than a few of the other entries in the series.In terms of action, it's packed right from the get go! The stunts that they used in this film are unbelievable. Of course everyone was talking about the opening scene with the aircraft that was used in the trailer, but it doesn't end there. That's literally just the beginning. So if action is what you want, that's what you'll get. It could have benefited from less CGI in the driving sequences, but they're fun to watch (II and III are much worse by comparison).The plot line by itself is a bit convoluted, as they were trying to emphasize the spy vs spy story-line that can be expected from every Mission Impossible film. The dialogue is also fairly complex to follow, which makes the storyline even harder to follow. The 'doublespeak' they used was pretty confusing to say the least, which has become the trend in most politically themed films. It doesn't ruin the film, but you don't watch something like this for the story. It kinda feels like they were going for a plot twist moment in every block of dialogue, which just ruins a storyline for me.And of course there is Tom Cruise. The seminal character that links all of these films together. He does a good job of maintaining the character of Ethan Hunt throughout the series, but in this entry into the series, this his him at his most over-the-top. Tom Cruise did some pretty great action sequences, and it paid off. I won't say anything negative about the actor himself, but I respect his stunt performances, driving ability, and what he brought into this film as an actor.

Now it seems the series is satisfied just putting out a solid action thriller with more focus on stunts than characters, plot, or even style.

There were some moments that were good though, particularly the opening sequence where Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt is hanging off the plane while it is taking off the runway.Mission Inpossible - Rogue Nation sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) reunite after an international criminal organisation known as the Syndicate is intent on eradicating the IMF. The Syndicate is led by the sinister Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Disavowed M16 agent Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is deep undercover within the Syndicate and although she is a secret ally to Ethan Hunt, she seemingly has a secret agenda which creates suspicions as to which side is she really on. To compound further problems for the IMF team, CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, who is perfect for his role) is spearheading his intentions to have the IMF disbanded via a hearing by the Senate Intelligence Committee.Age has not slowed Tom Cruise down at 52 years of age, and he still jumps around and leaps into action like he hasn't aged at all. It was good to see Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames again, Rebecca Ferguson was great as Isla Faust, Sean Harris made a slimy, sinister villain, and Alec Baldwin does what he does best.The story itself was nothing new, and most of the action sequences seemed to be routine.

Somewhere along the line, before seeing this latest installment, I had decided to re-watch the original four films and realized that the character of Ethan Hunt really has no defining characteristics beyond just basically being Tom Cruise. This bothered me for some reason. Jason Bourne was a fully fleshed out character and even the new Bond films had added newer elements to give a traditionally stereotypical character more depth and complexity, but Ethan Hunt is just...bland. He has no personality. What seemed even stranger to me was the fact that Mission Impossible was supposed to revolve around a team, yet Tom Cruise is seemingly always the only one who ever does anything. So basically these films boil down to watching Tom Cruise perform his own stunts, which I will admit are extremely impressive, especially in this latest escapade. However the plots of all five films are basically nonsense to try and connect each elaborate stunt to the next. Then I realized that all 5 films have remarkably similar story lines as well.

      "Scraping reviews for movie: Edge of Tomorrow (tt1631867)\n",
      "[{'movie_id': 'tt1631867', 'movie_title': 'Edge of Tomorrow', 'review_body': 'Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after \\'Battle L.A.\\' and \\'Oblivion\\' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as \\'Groundhog Day\\'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise\\'s character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise\\'s meatiest role since his turn in \\'Magnolia\\' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character ‚Äì and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won\\'t give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn\\'t a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as \"full metal bitch\" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don\\'t do anything here that you haven\\'t seen them do before. As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I\\'m glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can\\'t make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in \\'Saving Private Ryan\\' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first \\'Matrix\\' was (it IS breathtaking, though).So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we\\'ve seen in years, \\'Edge of Tomorrow\\' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/', 'rating': '9', 'title': 'Clever, intense Sci-Fi spectacle; offers nearly as much humor as it does excitement along with a great, unexpected turn from Tom Cruise'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1631867', 'movie_title': 'Edge of Tomorrow', 'review_body': \"Have I got something on my face!

Tom Cruise personally asked for him to direct \"Edge of Tomorrow,\" and Limon agreed to because the character Tom plays is NOT good at his (largely ceremonial) military position; the two have made a better movie as a result. Cruise also asked Emily Blunt, a fine actress with zero action film experience, to be in this one, and their rapport elevates it. Her own character, Rita, IS exceptional at her job as a battle-hardened vet. This silly sci-fi plot involves some global alien invasion in which certain aliens can \"reset\" time. So our 2 protagonists proceed to fight and die, together or separately, on the same day, over and over again, dozens if not hundreds of times.

Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself. You have to love Tom Cruise as an actor, he always gives his roles a 100 percent and he's phenomenal in Edge of Tomorrow - Physical, funny and determined. I'd say this is his best performance since Collateral. Emily Blunt is fantastically badass as the poster girl of the war, Rita Vrataski. This is her first real action film and she knocks it out of the park. Cruise and Blunt also have great chemistry together. Bill Paxton and Brandon Gleeson give great supporting performances and most of the supporting soldiers have distinct personalities even with their limited screen times. Edge of Tomorrow's world building is slick and credible. The CGI and the special effects are seamless and bring the great set pieces and the relentless aliens to life. The action is really exhilarating (the cool exoskeleton suits definitely help here) and the script is very witty and inventive as it needs to be when you're dealing with time travel (or time resets if you will). Despite its action thrills Edge of Tomorrow finds plenty of room for character development both for Cruise and Blunt. The script also manages to pull off some quite funny scenes (especially in the training segment). I also have to mention James Herbert's snappy editing because it's that good. The the situations could get old really fast if it wasn't for the fast-paced editing that concisely and freshly shows the differences in each repetition Cruise goes through. The pacing is absolutely relentless and there isn't a boring moment in the film. The tone of the film is pretty much perfect for a summer blockbuster. It's not overly morose or gloomy despite the backdrop of an alien invasion. Instead it opts for wit, fun and action thrills. I was really gripped from start to finish and I had this big grin on my face when I left the theater.

What I was going to say is, this movie has all the movie needs to be enjoyable.Private Cage is brought down to warfare against aliens, without reading \"Exoskeleton Suit for Dummies\" first. But oh my, he had this curse that Phil had in Punxsutawney that he had to die and respawn, and over and over and (over) again that he granted from an alien he killed.I don\\'t know, but apparently, the screenwriter was inspired by \"Groundhog Day\", which is a good thing. The pace really done well by describing Cage deals with time-loop. There are many possibilities of a man\\'s mind could think to take advantage of a powerful curse, and I think they explore this well, just like Groundhog Day.Good thing comes from the characters. They are lovable and some of them have great quotes. Emily Blunt really nailed the character of a hard-soldier that shared same fate with Cage in the past. She really balanced Tom Cruise\\'s performance.But enough exaggerating, shall I? There are minus-es too. Always.

I walked away quite liking this movie.Most of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.Re stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.For me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.Given that theme, the movie's style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.Be careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.But still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.Sure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.To me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.But that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.Plus the drones looked really really cool.Re copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own.

Who do you trust to inform you? What is true intimacy? And will Artificial Intelligence rule over mankind? To be frank, the true great villain in \"Oblivion\" is the human race itself: We are enslaving our own people, destroying our own planet and exterminating each other. But, to be even more precise, the true villains are the people in wealth and power (as portrayed here by sentient artificial intelligence). The millionaires and politicians are the ones who pay to keep us in the dark and on our hamster wheels, feeding them resources at the cost of all life on the surface of the Earth. In our reality, just like in the movie, mankind is engaged in repetitive tasks, staying alive and oblivious to its truth; living in superficial relationships with no real love and allowing the planet to be consumed. As such, you and I ARE the protagonist in this movie: A puppet on strings, fighting against itself and serving an evil, selfish and vampiric power that is corrupting the planet. We are living in the clouds and need to touch grass.To get the plastic point across, Director Joseph Kosinski employs wonderful vistas of our planet. The photography and prop design in this movie is truly something special (thank you, Claudio Miranda). The color palette also gets the plot across by driving in the difference between conscious and unconscious, earthly and artificial thru black, brown and green versus cream and grey. Thru an exaggerated script, (one which can be frustrating, especially during the first minutes of the film), we see that the ideal life our repairman leads is both luxurious and supposedly meaningful... but something is afoot; it doesn\\'t feel natural! Our protagonist has been fed false information, the same way we are told whatever suits the agenda of today\\'s media outlets. We notice in the movie that those who cannot accept the truth, refuse to engage with the planet; they live in the sky and are not \"down to Earth\". These people exist in real life, and can usually be found in wealthy circles who are far removed from any struggle, conflict or life difficulty. Because of this, they perceive others as inhuman or below them, when the truth is the exact opposite.In conclusion, whether it was Joseph Kosinski\\'s intention or not, \"Oblivion\" asks you to wake up and realize: You are overseeing the destruction of your human soul and are participating in the looting of planet Earth. But what do you do now? The film offers no other solution to this issue of the machine, other than to join a Jihad and bomb the system to kingdom come.

It has the exteriors of Planet of the Apes and a plot that runs and remind you of Alien, Total Recall, and I Am Legend(I don't want to spoil the next film that resembles). The first act is totally gripping by introducing its high concept. When it proceeds to the actual story, there is suppose to be even more mindblowing than it was shown. It throws away some intriguing twists, but the film doesn't bother explaining enough what's the point about it. There's also an interesting pathos of Jack missing the old less-broken world at the beginning, but the story easily ignores it. Many would think it doesn't matter, but that might possibly bring some soul to the picture. It's centrally about finding the protagonist's identity. The romance is ought to be important for his journey but this relationship wasn't develop much, leading as a typical love subplot. The performances are just typical for the actors. Tom Cruise plays his usual hero roles. It's fine for the film's character though. Morgan Freeman once again serving up details of the plot. The only thing what's different is he wears a costume that looks pretty good to him.Despite of the underwhelming storytelling, we still get to see some rich futuristic details. The film has its own style and creates a marvelous world. Other than the whimsically designed rubble of the destroyed earth, all the weapons, ships, and costumes are quite snazzy to appeal for those who seek for eye catching stuff.

Those thrills are just limited, though. He's still in his comfort zone by only caring for the pretty visuals and the techno soundtrack.Oblivion is almost better than it was expected. It would have been as good as it looks like if only it was eager to put more explanation about the intrigue, and soul to the story. It leaves the audience thought provoked.

It's a great thing especially for this era of blockbusters. Everything in the film looks stunning and breathtaking. It's terribly entertaining as well if we don't mind those flaws.

We get it, the visuals and the soundtrack are the best part of the film, but I think it deserves better than those.

The creators went to great efforts with many of the sets and props, constructing full size ships, and massive screens to project backgrounds, rather than just use blue screen and CGI, which I feel responsible for ruining many modern films.

Classic!). I loved the pacing and the great interaction between players. Sure, some of the one liners seemed a tad forced, but they were not so common. Well done Cruise again.Do yourselves a favour. Ignore the negative reviewers and give this a go.\", 'rating': '8', 'title': 'Watch this film'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0790724', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher', 'review_body': 'Saw JACK REACHER on Monday night at an advance screening. Here\\'s some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.First off, I\\'d say I agree with the general critical reception: 4/5 stars. To me that means it\\'s a solid movie that delivers at the high end of its genre. JACK REACHER isn\\'t trying to be anything revolutionary, it\\'s more the kind of action thriller audiences haven\\'t seen for a while.This isn\\'t MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE or even James Bond. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes his inspiration from action movies of the late 60s/early 70s like DIRTY HARRY (which has been name checked in a couple reviews already), BULLITT (for the car chase); and maybe another Don Siegel movie, CHARLEY VARRICK. The excitement here doesn\\'t come from over the top stunts or huge explosions. Like the action movies just referenced, you thrill to watching a strongly defined protagonist outsmart, outfight and outmaneuver the bad guys.Which brings me to the character of Jack Reacher and the casting of Tom Cruise. In the series of novels by Lee Child this movie is based on, Jack Reacher is an ex-MP detective. After a lifetime spent on military bases overseas, he lives as a drifter in the United States who adheres to a life of zero commitments: No house, no job, no car, no possessions, no family. Oh, and he stands 6\\'5\" and weighs 250 lbs.Clearly Tom Cruise doesn\\'t match that physical description. What makes Reacher such a great character in Child\\'s books though has far less to do with his exterior than it does with his intellect. If you\\'ve read the series as I have, it\\'s a little strange at first. As the film played out however, I got more relaxed and more into it. This was definitely a movie about Lee Child\\'s hero Jack Reacher, physical differences be damned.Would I have preferred an unknown actor closer to Child\\'s description to play Reacher on screen? Yes, of course. But I could say that about virtually any character, and often do. I generally want unknowns for everything.Which is where Cruise\\'s casting comes in handy a bit. Because his casting sort of guarantees a certain amount of box office, it means the filmmakers can take more chances. Like crafting an action movie that\\'s longer on character and occasional brutal violence and short on mindless action and impossible nonsense.JACK REACHER was a very satisfying action thriller for me. I felt it captured what I love about Lee Child\\'s thrillers and Jack Reacher in particular. I\\'d definitely recommend it, and I\\'m going to see it in the theater again. That\\'s for damn sure.', 'rating': '8', 'title': 'JACK REACHER: Action movie-making done right!'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0790724', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher', 'review_body': \"Considering the mixed reception that 'Jack Reacher' has garnered, most of the critical external reviews have been positive or mixed feelings but it also received a lot of backlash from fans of the books, it was hard to say how 'Jack Reacher' was going to turn out.When finally seeing it, the film is far from perfect by all means but to me it was not bad at all. In fact it was very enjoyable with a number of strengths. It's a very well-made film, stylishly and atmospherically shot with a neo-noir feel while there are some good use of locations and the editing is tight and crisp, making the action coherent and not resorting to the often seizure-inducing shaky cam technique. The music is energetic and haunting without being brash or overly-bombastic, with very effective use of silence.Despite a few draggy and too padded out scenes (particularly the overlong and far too talky scene with Jack and Helen trying to piece things altogether) and an anaemic - due to the lack of tension-, anti-climactic and all too convenient ending, the story is paced very nicely and is always diverting. The twists and turns ensure some good tension and suspense and it never feels too predictable, hackneyed or convoluted. There's also the use of flashbacks to remind the viewer of anything important, thankfully they're not overused or repetitive. The action is exciting rather than overly-loud and generic with the right amount of chaos and urgency, like the brawl and the fight in the hallway. Character interaction is strong, with the central one between Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike having some nice moments, and Jack is a very interesting character.Most of the acting is good. Whatever has been said of Tom Cruise being physically completely wrong (often described by detractors as one of the biggest miscasts ever), he still makes for a charismatic and intense hero that has steel in his eyes and plays it appropriately straight despite the campiness of some of one-liners. Am amazed at well he deals with the action, his energy and dexterity are enviable. In support, two fare particularly strongly. One is Robert Duvall, his role is quite small but he brings a very memorable curmudgeon wit. The other, and even more so, is Werner Herzog's spine-tingling villain, his story of how he came to lose his fingers is the film's most chilling moment. Richard Jenkins is strong if underutilised, likewise with David Oyelowo. The biggest surprise was Jai Courtney in the best performance this viewer has seen from him, unlike his awful performances in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' and 'Terminator Genysis' he actually isn't annoying and he has a personality too. 'Jack Reacher' starts on a wonderfully tense note too, so much so that one wishes that that quality of tension was there at the end, and while Christopher McQuarrie is a better writer than he is a director he directs more than serviceably here.Sadly, there are drawbacks. Much has been said already in the review about the ending and some draggy pacing and padding, but another problem is the overlong length with some of the third act feeling forced dialogue-wise and bloated. The two biggest problems with 'Jack Reacher' are the script and (as much as I hate to say it) the performance of Rosamund Pike. There are some clever and funny moments in the script but the amount of times the one-liners were cheesy and forced and the film became too talky in a long-winded fashion were more numerous. Pike is a much better actress than she is given credit for, and she has given some good to great performances in good to great films (especially her brilliant performance in 'Gone Girl') and has even been a redeeming factor in mediocre/bad ones or heavily problematic ones, but her performance here is one of her worst in a role that wastes her. She is not helped by her character, who is bland and underwritten and it was like the writers couldn't decide what personality to give her and her dialogue is well below par and is frankly beneath Pike, but this viewer has never seen her look so stiff and bug-eyed (she has showed much more expression and range than here before, despite what her detractors say) and the performance was an uncomfortable mix of melodrama and phoning in.In conclusion, while far from flawless 'Jack Reacher' has a lot of great things still and judging it as a standalone is very enjoyable. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox\", 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Very enjoyable film, with a few drawbacks but also a number of strengths'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0790724', 'movie_title': 'Jack Reacher', 'review_body': \"I have read all the Jack Reacher's books (at least the novels and short stories written by Lee Child) so I knew the plot pretty well and it is well rendered for most of the movie. The first half is spot on, sharp to deliver the action like Lee Child: with a lot of thought but few words.Then, for some reason it strays from this really fine rendition. My guess is that they couldn't cope with the overwhelming violence of Jack Reacher's stories. They did not want something too off-putting for the masses since Tom Cruise was supposed to bring in a larger crowd. So why did they chose this one story in the first place? Obviously they dug the beginning, the premise and it shows: it is the one thing that is perfectly adapted. But, hello, this is a story which starts with a mass shooting! Certainly the worst kind of terror attack you can show when you specifically focus on the doomed victims in the cross-hairs of the sniper's sight...I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise and casting him as the imposing silent square-jawed Jack Reacher was definitely baffling. I don't mind much about the size, that is definitely in the realm of creative license for the adapters. Now you can only stretch the adaptation so far without losing the concentrated spirit of the original material. So the real problem is that Tom Cruise always wants to flash his smile, to be funny and agreeable at some point. But Jack Reacher is above all an introverted loner, he does not display his emotions when he is hurt by some bad guy's actions: he dutilfully registers this and takes the steps towards some retribution.That was the real challenge of bringing Jack Reacher to life, not betraying his original inner strength but making him likable... wild and sexy. In this adaptation of One Shot I cannot understand how they could underuse Rosamund Pike to make her play a frigid attorney whereas Reacher absolutely needs some kind of a delicately veiled lascivous sidekick. Instead we get a scene that is fine for Tom Cruise but totally at odds with the Jack Reacher character where he takes a step to seduce a girl that is basically not sufficiently attracted. Here they miss the mark big time.Then you get the fight in the bathroom that is comical, which is ok except that it shows Reacher at a disadvantage. That was certainly dumb to have the great Jack Reacher being taken by surprise by two dimwit thugs.Jack Reacher as Frank BullittNow this is icebox logic, I reckon. Where the movie actually starts losing it for me is with the stupid car chase (Jack Reacher does not like to drive, isn't that an interesting plot device?). Then Reacher doesn't team up with the attorney and does alone to the shooting range. It is great to have Robert Duvall but well... that is a setup that does jettison the fantastic ending in the book. Instead we get some run-of-the-mill shoot-out in a quarry that sorely reminds you of all these movies that ended up behind schedule and out of budget when it was time to wrap it up.Really a pity that they would show so much energy and talent at the beginning and then got lazy or tired or something to just dish out something that does not come together as a Jack Reacher adventure.And confirming this, yes it is getting even worse till the very end with that final moaning of the sniper after Jack Reacher is eventually off to a new destination.

One would wish they could\\'ve gotten a bigger and taller actor to play the role like Hugh Jackman, or Chris Evans, or someone else. It could have been a new iconic appearance for a hero. The real problem is it seems Tom Cruise is just redoing his generic action hero performance. As much as he refuses to call himself a hero, he still looks like one but in a much glossier way. In spite of that, the film itself is a snazzy piece of entertainment that is rare in cinema these days. A neo-noir styled action blockbuster that will grip you by its storytelling and its action scenes. There\\'s a chance that could have made this a much better film but put aside those complains, it\\'s still pretty awesome.The film begins with a man shooting five random innocent people. It effectively builds tension by being silent. The rest of the movie is as slick as the opening and it serves a great entertainment. The only disappointment is Tom Cruise.

His fans might still think he\\'s pretty cool for it. I\\'m not a fan of comparing a book to its film adaptation. I never cared if a single plot point or character was changed, but the Jack Reacher character is the real deal here. It seems this film is only made for Cruise to get him back in action. Well this character is not for him.The film is still solidly made. At least it doesn\\'t go to the modern generic action movie direction that is relentlessly loud but sticks to the neo-noir storytelling. The best parts is when it spends time in scrutinizing the case in silence. When the film starts talking, the dialogue is witty and interests the story\\'s investigation. It gets exciting when it goes to the action. The action scenes are well shot. The hand-to-hand combat fight scenes reminiscence the cool eighties action with some humorous camp. The car chase is the most impressive sequence where it shows several angles as they drive away without shaking the camera. It has the potential of a classic throwback.Jack Reacher is quite entertaining but again they should have gotten the right actor to play the lead. Jack Reacher here is nothing more than another Tom Cruise character with a leather jacket and do what this old man usually do. The only good thing is it\\'s not bad. It\\'s a decent kind of action thriller that isn\\'t famous in mainstream cinema anymore, but yet is enjoyable. It\\'s not entirely an action film though, but people might think it is.

Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making \\'One Shot\\', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, \"this must be an April Fool\\'s joke. A 5\\'7\" skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6\\'5\" Jack Reacher? This can\\'t be happening.\" Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn\\'t being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn\\'t putting on the raspy \\'animal-like\\' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.Lee Child once made a great analogy to Jack Reacher. He said \"does anyone remember the story lines in the Dirty Harry Movies? Not a chance. But they sure as hell remember the character.\" The Reacher books are about a single thing, and that is Jack Reacher. Don\\'t get me the wrong, the stories in 90% of the books released so far are masterpieces and could easily be made into great films. But they still remain a vehicle for which Jack Reacher can thrive in. And the producers proved that they realised this (albeit very late in the piece) by renaming the movie \\'Jack Reacher\\'. A little in-your-face for my liking, but I could see why it was necessary so I didn\\'t hold it against them. However I did reserve my right to hold Tom Cruise\\'s casting against them. And I was right to. Did Tom Cruise pull off the great character of Jack Reacher? Not in your life.Cruise was cast badly, and then went on to play the role even worse. Not a great combination if you\\'re an actor. Heath Ledger took the opposite route in his role as The Joker in Christopher Nolan\\'s 2008 masterpiece \"The Dark Knight\". He was hugely criticised for being completely wrong for the part when he was cast and we all know how that turned out. Cruise unfortunately did not rise to the challenge in the same way.For starters, I\\'m reasonably confident he was the shortest person in the film. Not one effort was made to make him look the least bit impressive stature wise. His haircut was ridiculous. He looked like a guy who goes to the hair salon twice a week for touch-ups. In fact Jai Courtney in the role of the Charlie had what I always imagined to be the perfect haircut for Reacher. Perhaps he would\\'ve been better placed in the role? Cruise\\'s shoulders were not broad enough. At one stage a character asks \"I\\'m looking for a guy who could kill a man with one punch?\" To which he is directed straight to Reacher. Get real. Rosamund Pike was probably more likely to kill someone that way than Cruise. Cruise did not alter his voice one bit for the movie. This was a huge disappointment for me. I had really hoped he would do something like what Christian Bale did when he was in the Batman suit, only not quite to the same degree, but for the whole movie. Cruise sounded almost feminine performing some of the lines. Lastly, he kept bloody smiling (or smirking, whatever you want to call it). I was OK with him cracking the odd joke here and there, because Reacher can be a bit of a smart-ass, but he didn\\'t have to look so damn proud of himself every time he did it. Reacher\\'s an animal, 24-7, he (very) rarely smiles and he takes life very seriously.The script was solid, it stayed pretty faithful to the book. I found the jokes and one-liners a little too frequent for my liking and took away from what should have been a dark atmosphere. Unfortunately, Reacher was never really challenged physically. Sure, everyone he fought was bigger than him, but that\\'s only because Cruise is so short. Never once did I think to myself \\'how\\'s Reacher possibly going to take down this guy?\" Which always makes for the best fight scenes. One part of the script I did not like at all, again regarding the \\'bad guys\\', was when two of them, whilst trying to attack Reacher, were practically fighting each other even harder. And just because they wanted to get through the door first? I felt like I was watching \\'Home Alone\\' or something. I assume they were going for comedic value but it just went far too far for my liking.The rest of the cast were solid at best, in fact I found Rosamund Pike well below average in her performance, but I wasn\\'t too bothered by this because they were the epitome of a support cast. They weren\\'t who people came to see. People came to see Cruise and he let them down. The interesting thing is that the movie isn\\'t being panned across the board, which is testament to how good the story is. It\\'s a great story and could easily have been done without Reacher, which is basically what has happened for people who haven\\'t read the books. They don\\'t have those to compare the character to and so they leave the theater quite happily. And that\\'s great for them. But for the rest of us they have ruined a great character.

The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older.

David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective.

Like most musicals, it has a great buzz and electric feel to it. You can\\'t help but finish this film with a big smile on your face and its a very feel good comfort experience.The production value was also great, from the sets to the costumes, everything felt realistic and just looked cool.Then there\\'s the key part of any musical, the songs. You can\\'t fault the selection, there were numerous classics which just kept on coming. Maybe a little too much.I couldn\\'t help but feel like there were just too many songs. There wasn\\'t any time to take a breather and the story wasn\\'t allowed to develop outside of the music. As a result I couldn\\'t find myself connecting to any of the characters and I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunity to develop the plot and characters because of the amount of songs.This wasn\\'t the only problem with the plot... it was all over place. Was this film about Sherry, Drew, Stacee Jaxx, Patricia, Lonnie and Dennis? Who knows. There was too much sharing of the spotlight, and the constant changing of perspectives and protagonists started to give me whiplash. I think things would have benefitted from having a more obvious and clear protagonist to root for and follow, which would have given the film more drive and direction.I also had mixed feeling about the characters. What Russell Brand was doing with his sporadic Brummie accent I\\'ll never know. He\\'s never been a great actor, and the accent just made everything so much worse. The two \"main\" characters of Sherrie and Drew were also pretty bland and I wasn\\'t that fussed about them. Tom Cruise on the other hand, what a surprise. Easily the best thing about this film. He threw himself into this role and it massively paid off. It\\'s worth watching for him alone.Finally, as much as I liked the selection of songs, the singing wasn\\'t always on point and was quite obviously auto tuned to a heavy extent for some of them. I think musical films need to start finding a better balance between casting big names to get bums on seats, but also casting actors who can sing.Rock of Ages is definitely fun, and any musical lover will find lots to enjoy here.

The song list they had chosen to sing in this movie went along with the storyline and flowed throughout the movie. As for the singing, well it was spot on and delightful to listen to. Had me singing a lot of the songs with them. Each character was playing such a big role with the almost ensemble cast it seemed. Tom Cruise crushed it as the Rock Legend Stacee Jaxx it was very intriguing to see what his character would do throughout the movie. Julianne Hough was stunningly beautiful in every scene and her singing was nice as well, but it seemed she could use some better acting. Mary J.

There are a few I\\'ve enjoyed enough to see fit as additions to my collection (e.g. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) and I\\'ve enjoyed some of the old Rogers and Hammerstein films. As a general rule, I don\\'t seem to find much enjoyment in movie musicals for a few reasons, most of which I\\'ll spare you here. But there is one glaringly painful problem I have with movie musicals and ROCK THE AGES happens to suffer from it more than any other musical I\\'ve seen: the lip syncing. I hate poorly done lip-syncing and this movie is chock full of it. Right from the start, it\\'s enough to rip me out of the movie. ROCK OF AGES is a musical that I expected to love. The cast was impressive, the music selection was amazing, and I maintain the \\'80s as one of my guilty pleasures. I was born in the early \\'80s and so the decade has a pretty special place in my mind. I was really hoping this movie would be a super fun look back at a decade of excess, bizarre fashion, and great music. When the reviews began to roll in and the word was primarily negative, I knew this wouldn\\'t be one to catch in theaters. Instead, I waited until the eventual home video release and I\\'m glad I did. Based on the stage show of the same name, the movie is about a small- town girl who moves to Los Angeles in search of her big break. She finds a job waitressing at the Bourbon, an L.A. music hot spot, and finds love with an aspiring musician as the \\'80s and it\\'s music come to an end.The casting in this movie is hit and miss, with a whole lot of misses. Let\\'s start with our leads: Diego Boneta (as Drew Boley) and Julianne Hough (as Sherrie Christian) as our small- town girl and city boy. I have no problem with movies casting unknowns, but these two did absolutely nothing for me. Hough is apparently best known for her time on TV\\'s \"Dancing with the Stars\" and Boneta is a musician/actor popular in Mexico. Hough does well enough but brings absolutely nothing extra to her role (aside from a fine singing voice and some pole-dancing talent), which is a shame seeing as how she\\'s the female lead. Boneta is just horribly miscast. Drew is supposed to be an aspiring rock star. He\\'s supposed to embody \\'80s rock-and-roll and the passion of the music. Instead, he\\'s a pretty boy that looks completely out of place. Watching him try and put on a rocker\\'s attitude and strut around on stage, slinging a guitar, is laughable. He seems more at home in the \\'90s boy band parody Z Guyeezz in the later half of the movie than at any point when he\\'s trying to be Wolfgang von Colt. The best hope is the supporting cast and, for the most part, they do a great job of saving what of the movie they can. With one exception: Alec Baldwin. Baldwin can be funny, and he has some good material here. But he just doesn\\'t fit. He comes off as an old man trying to run with the cool young crowd, and the little singing he does is cringe-worthy.The rest fare pretty well: Catherina Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti, Malin √Ökerman, Russell Brand (who looks completely at home in the movie), and Mary J. Blige (one of the most talented vocal talents in the movie, for obvious reasons). The best part of the movie by far is Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. I never would\\'ve guessed Cruise had it in him to play a rock legend, but the man is awesome. Jaxx is the best part of the movie and, if the whole movie had been focused on his character, it would\\'ve been a million times more entertaining. Cruise may be a weird dude in his personal life but the guy\\'s got talent. Cruise is given the chance to perform songs by Bon Jovi, Guns N Roses, the Scorpions, and Def Leppard and he pulls them all off perfectly with rock star flair. Which leads me to the best part of the movie: the music. With bonus points for some creative choreography, the music is the only reason to check this movie out. Any fans of the \\'80s rock era will love the soundtrack to the film. I would\\'ve given the movie a lower rating but I can\\'t help but enjoy the movie, especially when I\\'m not really paying attention to it.

It\\'s not that Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) didn\\'t deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Cruise, it\\'s just that there are so few of these moments that he is, in many ways, almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.Personally I felt a greater presence and sense of danger from the female assassin, Sabine Moreau (Lea Seydoux ‚Äì Robin Hood), a beautiful yet malicious woman with a cold heartless gaze, completely devoid of compassion. In my opinion she\\'d have made a much better leading villain, especially as her actions do personally effect one of the team, but despite this little hiccup there is certainly more than enough obstacles to keep Hunt and his team busy and the audience well and truly entertained so this is really just nit-picking on my part.After the relative disappointment of the second Mission: Impossible film, first time feature director J.J. Abrams (of TV\\'s ALIAS and Lost fame) injected some much needed heart and soul into the third installment, expertly balancing a romantic subplot with the high-octane action sequences all fans demand of such a film. Although Abrams was not going to direct the fourth film it was reassuring to see that he was still involved as a producer so I had relatively high hopes that Ghost Protocol would live up to MI3 and I wasn\\'t disappointed.Like MI3 before it Ghost Protocol\\'s director\\'s chair is filled with another first timer of sorts and like the previous chapter that \\'gamble\\' has paid off. Although Brad Bird is not a first time feature helmer this is his first foray into the world of live action so he might not seem to be the most obvious choice but there was never any doubt from either Abrams or Cruise about his talent and potential to deliver a great film. Bird\\'s impressive previous credits include The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille (the last two having won Academy Awards for best Animated Feature Film). Like Abrams, Bird has also had great success on the small screen as an executive consultant on the Simpsons and I\\'ve been a fan of his work since chancing upon Family Dog (from Spielberg\\'s \\'Amazing Stories\\' series) in the early 90\\'s.Simon Pegg (Paul) reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3, the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a \\'behind the desk cameo\\' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt\\'s rogue team. Pegg\\'s natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a much-needed element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton ‚Äì Deja Vu) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner ‚ÄìThe Hurt Locker), and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona\\'s with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we\\'re not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie.

Before the movie started, there was an introduction by Director Brad Bird, and by actor Simon Pegg where they shared how much they enjoyed making the film and shooting scenes in the IMAX format.I won\\'t get into the story too much as I don\\'t want to ruin it for anyone, but the basic plot is that the Kremlin in Russia is bombed by a terrorist group and IMF is framed for it. Because of these actions, the president decides to activate Operation Ghost Protocol, which essentially means that the entire IMF organisation is disavowed, meaning Ethan and his team are on their own, and like the tagline says \"No Plan, No Backup, No Choice\".The story I found to be quite solid. Nothing groundbreaking but enough to keep the interest of your average movie-goer.The performances were generally good all around. Simon Pegg was enjoyable as Benji and Tom Cruise is always great as Ethan Hunt. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton also gave some great performances. The action sequences are where the film really shines. Not all scenes were great, I thought the bombing of the Kremlin used some very fake looking CGI which made it more humorous then intense. Also, some scenes seemed a little too far-fetched and made me think that Tom Cruise must be made of steel or something. But if you try not to look into this too much, then chances are you will enjoy the action. The fight scenes were done very well, incredibly brutal and realistic looking. The sound for this film really helped as you could almost feel every punch and kick as well as the explosions. The greatest scene for me was Ethan climbing the hotel in Dubai, the worlds most tallest building. Shot in IMAX as well, I almost felt like I was right there next to Ethan looking down from above. Huge credit goes to Tom Cruise for performing this stunt himself!Overall, I found the film very enjoyable. I enjoyed it a lot more than the 2nd and 3rd entries, but the 1st has always been the best one for me.

Not only he\\'s ascending the super-tall structure, he\\'s going to infiltrate the Kremlin in Moscow, chase people in a huge sandstorm, and of course ... save the world. The story: the IMF is accused for bombing the Kremlin, although they were not actually the perpetrators. Due to this, the IMF is shut down and \"Operation Ghost Protocol\" is launched with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and William Brandt(Jeremy Renner), a group of 4 people being what is left of the IMF. Together, they find that there was another person behind the bombing code-named \"Cobalt\" and he has a plan to ignite a nuclear war which he believes would begin the next stage of human evolution. From beginning to end, I was hooked by all the action scenes. The action scenes and all the moves are spectacular. The hand-to-hand combats, the chase scenes, the gunfights are very well-done and spectacular. The cinematography was excellent and one of the best in years. Of course, the Burj Khalifa scene was the trademark of the whole film. Ethan Hunt climbing the Burj Khalifa was thrilling enough. But with a limited time, having trouble going back down, and running around and swinging around the structure just quickens the pace of the story and makes the scene very stylish. This scene is just outstanding and will be one of the highlights of the film. The acting was very well-done. After 5 years of absence in the series, Tom Cruise still got his spy skills here. Paula Patton\\'s bad girl character is very well-played. Simon Pegg as the clumsy-but-genius Benji Dunn was amazing. Jeremy Renner as the so-called-analyst-but- actually-IMF-agent William Brandt was stunning and great. The performances of the actors/actresses are very strong and convincing.I love the technology used in this film. They are just unreal. A device that lets you float using magnetic attraction. A device that copies the scenery behind and displays it into a screen that allows you to deceive other people who are looking at the screen. A suit that turns into a casual jacket when you wear it inside-out. All of these devices are creatively made and looking at them being operated is just so fun. And be sure to see the amazing BMW Vision (a futuristic, BMW concept car) in a scene set in Dubai. (Also, this movie is keen about BMWs.)The mission tactics are also ingenious. The tactics are very smart and are very entertaining. How they create diversions in the most unlikely situations and the scenes involving the composition of a plan keep the film in a constant quick pace and increases the suspense of the film. When they take their tactics into action, that\\'s where they get more interesting. The comedy here adds up the fun in this film. Sometimes, prolonged scenes of action are just too noisy and make the movie feel plain. But not here. The comedy scenes here act as intervals between so we don\\'t always see long, noisy, and bloated action scenes (major trouble of \"Transformers\") and make sure that we have a perfect dose of both. All these elements are very well-done and balanced and together form a suspenseful, fast-paced, and thrilling, yet funny action ride worth to experience. I think we should thank genius director Brad Bird for successfully revitalizing the movie series. This movie is just brilliant and I think it\\'s because of Bird\\'s genius directing. Final Verdict: With fast-paced directing by Brad Bird and exciting action sequences, yet with funny moments, this movie is a thrilling ride worth to experience.

Bird relies on larger-than-life live action stunts (particularly thrilling on the IMAX) rather than rely on CGI fakery or shaky camera work. This more traditional but more realistic direction adds to the fun. Tom Cruise has (and does) the best stunts, of course, but the rest of team also contribute much more than in the previous films. This shift in emphasis by the writers also contributes to the fun by allowing all the characters to actually play an important or critical role (best shown in the last sequence in India) rather than just 'be helpers' to Tom Cruise. This too was a compelling characteristic of the original series.The cast is enjoyable, and the bits of comic dialog add to the fun. The occasional failures of some of the gadgetry also provide lighthearted moments, keeping the film light enough so that it is balanced and proportional, with the correct mix of action, suspense, and relief. It never takes itself too seriously, which is appropriate to the genre.Best seen while eating popcorn.\", 'rating': '7', 'title': 'All-around fun and puts the team back in Mission: Impossible'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1229238', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol', 'review_body': 'After Tom Cruise had a falling out with Paramount following his controversial behavior in mid 2000s from his ranting about psychiatrists and promotion of Scientology, it seemed somewhat unlikely that another Mission: Impossible film would be in the offing starring him. But in Hollywood, time heals all wounds, at least where there is money to be made. So, several years later, here is the fourth entry in the Mission: Impossible film franchise, subtitled Ghost Protocol. And, most interestingly, it is one of the better entries in the series, featuring some strong action set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of their seat at several key points in the proceedings.Ghost Protocol finds Ethan Hunt (Cruise) in prison in Russia at the opening under mysterious circumstances. Sprung by IMF agents in a sequence that brings to mind the opening of a James Bond film, we quickly learn that Ethan is needed to help locate and stop a former Russian politician named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) who believes that the only way to achieve global peace is to start a nuclear war and let the survivors sort out the mess. Joined by Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and a somewhat unwilling analyst named Brandt (Jeremy Renner) who has been forced by circumstances to work with the team, Ethan finds that, after the Kremlin is bombed, that the President has \"disavowed\" the entire IMF by declaring Ghost Protocol, and they must work outside of official sanction to stop Hendricks from detonating a nuclear weapon with stolen launch codes. The trail for him takes them from Russia to Dubai and finally Mumbai as they race against the clock.At first glance, you might find yourself wondering how three of the four Mission: Impossible films finds the team outside of their support system and being treated as terrorists; haven\\'t the writers seen the other films and don\\'t they get a little beat of wandering down the same road so many times. But, frankly, as with the ever ongoing Bond films, Mission: Impossible is less about plot and more about its action sequences, and this time the film has delivered in spades. Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol features the live-action debut of animation director Brad Bird, who helmed Pixar\\'s hit The Incredibles, and he does a good job of assembling strong, involving set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of its seat. The standout is the middle portion, set in Dubai, where script contrivances lead Ethan to need to scale the exterior of Burj Khalifa, the world\\'s tallest building. Bird stages these scenes stunningly, really ramping up the vertigo and tension as Hunt uses glue-like gloves to climb the side of the glass windowed tower. Other set pieces in Russia and Mumbai also have zip to them, keeping the suspense solid throughout.If Ghost Protocol has weaknesses, they are largely in the development of the villains. Hendricks and his henchman Wistrom (Samuli Edelmann) have the basic makings of some nice megalomaniacal villains, but suffer from limited screen time and some very limited depth. They serve the plot\\'s basic need for villains, but don\\'t really come across as the kind of visceral bad guys you love to hate. As much as the nuclear launch codes Ethan and team are chasing, they fill the standard Hitchcock position of the MacGuffin, and don\\'t make a lasting impression on the audience.Back for his fourth turn as Ethan, Cruise is dependable as always, giving Hunt that reserved, slightly above it all attitude that keeps him largely cool under fire, but he does have his moments when the guard is lowered and you can see him concerned about the stakes they are fighting for. Paula Patton is attractive in the role of Jane, who the script gives some more personal drive in the search for Hendricks and his cronies, Pegg delivers some welcome comic relief in the role of Benji and Renner, who has been rumored to be groomed for future Mission: Impossible films if Cruise steps down, holds his own in the action sequences, as well as providing the audience with a semi-outsider to empathize with as the circumstances consistently get higher and higher for the characters past what he is used to dealing with in his role as an analyst thrown into the action.For the most part, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol delivers a strong, fast, popcorn munching action film that provides thrills without turning into an over-edited explosion fest that you often get from a film directed by Michael Bay. If this is what the Mission: Impossible franchise can deliver on its fourth outing, then it may have plenty of entries for years to come.', 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Surprisingly strong fourth entry'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1229238', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol', 'review_body': \"The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission: Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone, who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofa-hopping TV antics, and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to ¬£75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs (2007), Valkyrie (2008), and Knight and Day (2010) failing to impress at the box office, while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office, attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his well-disguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008) in which he plays a the foul-mouthed, hot-headed, half-bald studio executive. But, every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front, Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol.Ghost Protocol takes the viewer on a roller coaster of a ride from Moscow to Dubai, all the way to Mumbai, never allowing a breathing space, keeping him on the edge of the seat throughout. MI ‚Äì GP is indeed the quintessential action extravaganza that the ardent lovers of the genre perpetually anticipate to devour upon in order to satiate their ever growing hunger for unremitting action and adventure. Ethan Hunt is back in all his glory with some newly added dimensions to his old daredevilry that had established him as the greatest contemporary to Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. As seen with Bond in Casino Royale, the key men behind the MI franchise have made conscious efforts to make the caricature of Hunt more vulnerable to danger and crises, and hence more human. MI ‚Äì GP delivers everything that an action-movie lover craves for: suspense, intrigue, passion, daredevilry, razzmatazz, and much more. The adrenaline filled action is well complemented by the dazzle of the geeky gadgets on display and it is this synergy that makes MI ‚Äì GP an incredibly sublime experience. The tremendous reputation that the high octane franchise carries meant the newly appointed director Brad Bird‚Äîmostly renowned for his animation flicks The Incredibles and Ratatouille‚Äîhad his work cut out for him. Brad Bird has indeed been up to the task and has lived well to the expectations of Cruise and the entire production team led by J.J. Adams, who directed the third movie of the series back in 2006. Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Ghost Protocol is packed with a plethora of action sequences that includes a shootout in Budapest, an escape sequence from a Moscow Jail, a sandstorm chase in Dubai, and a classic brawl in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. However, the sequence that stands out is the one in which Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa by clinging to it from the outside using suction gloves, giving the Spiderman a run for his money. After the splendidly executed siege of the Vatican in the third installment, Ethan and his IMF team are on the lookout for some classified information pertaining to a Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks, which takes their quest to Kremlin. The covert mission goes awry as their plan is sabotaged by the personal intervention of Hendricks, which turns the tables on Cruise and his team rendering them sequestered and helpless. The questionable events that unfold at Kremlin, forces the US President to invoke the Ghost Protocol leading to the disavowal of IMF. Ethan and his team, which includes the computer geek Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), despite their severe handicap are the only hope left at preventing the diabolical duo of Hendricks and his stalwart Wistrom from fulfilling their demonic mission of global destruction through a nuclear war. Simon Pegg as Benji is spot on with his persiflage, and his nonchalance adds a much needed levity to the otherwise tense plot. Paula Patton as Jane Carter is a treat to the sore eyes: her imperial gait, upright posture, predatory agility, dusky complexion, steamy mystique, athletic built, curvaceous figure, and apparent haughtiness make her an object of envy for males and females alike. Her ethereal presence undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt adds another layer of intrigue to the plot of MI ‚Äì GP. Brandt's enigmatic part allows Renner to depict a wide array of emotions that his previous roles couldn't offer. The over-hyped inclusion of veteran Indian actor Anil Kapoor in the MI ‚Äì GP cast is undoubtedly movie's greatest disappointment, especially from the perspective of Indian cineastes, as the actor fails to make an impression during his ephemeral performance.Overall, MI ‚Äì GP has managed to raise the bar for the Action genre. Indian movie-makers, who have recently started to delve into the genre, can look to take a note or two out of MI ‚Äì GP in order to iron out the usual glitches. Despite the occasional lack of coherence in the plot, MI ‚Äì GP works quite well at almost all the levels and promises to be a great entertainment. 8/10www.apotpourriofvestiges.com\", 'rating': '8', 'title': 'A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Action flick of the year, should you choose to watch it!'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1229238', 'movie_title': 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol', 'review_body': \"At this point we're all familiar with the mission impossible franchise.Just when it seemed like they didn't know what they were doing and the franchise was dying, this movie brought it back from the dead.

In the meantime, the bad guys are looking for the battery and are not too thrilled about who holds its possession.First, let\\'s get to the positives. First off, I liked that this movie established character development. Most action/comedy films fail to fully flesh out are leads and then we aren\\'t registered with them. 3:10 to Yuma director makes us care about these characters, and when put in a tough situation, we just hope the best. Second of all, I thought the script was great. I thought this movie had some really funny one-liners and the film had great comic timing. It couldn\\'t have been better. Thirdly, I thought that the performances were great. All the characters did their job and even stood out, especially Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Diaz and Cruise also had wonderful chemistry and their relationship never felt forced or phony. It came out as very authentic rather than artificial and syrupy. Moreover, I thought the film\\'s pacing was excellent. The film is shy of two hours, yet feels like half of that. After the film was over, I thought there would be at least another hour added. Furthermore, I thought the action was awesome. It definitely delivered and this is the best action I\\'ve seen in a long time. And lastly, the cinematography was just amazing. I loved the scenery and great production values I must add.There are very minimal flaws with this movie. However, there are some. First of all, I know this film is intentionally nonsensical, but some scenes went so over-the-top, that when it occasionally was meant to be serious, it came off as cheesy or laugh worthy, fortunately, like I said, occasionally. Second of all, I enjoyed this movie so much that I just wish it were longer. Overall, \"Knight and Day\" is a great film because of its fresh script, great performances, amazing action, great comic timing, breathtaking cinematography, and a fascinating direction. And for the first time, it\\'s actually not mindless! If you keep your brain on, you\\'ll still thoroughly enjoy it. If you were disappointed by \"Killers\", don\\'t worry, so was I, because you will still like this movie. Shoot, I enjoyed it so much I think it\\'s even better than \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" which I liked. \"Knight and Day\" is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. See it at night with a large crowd, with a big bucket of popcorn, and a drink, and you\\'ll have a blast. I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted it to last from \"Knight\" to \"Day\".

Cute, seemingly coincidental airport encounters connect an attractive blonde, Cameron Diaz, who is en route to her sister\\'s wedding, with a handsome man of mystery, Tom Cruise, and a series of wildly improbable events ensues. An early scene aboard a near-empty airliner is perhaps the film\\'s highlight, as Cruise does battle with unknown assailants, while a blissfully unaware Diaz primps in the restroom, intent on seducing Cruise. Perhaps if the humor and pace of this scene had been sustained, the film would have been more successful. If Cary Grant were the dashing stranger and Katharine Hepburn the unwitting accomplice, the film would have been classic.However, while they are attractive leads, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are not Grant and Hepburn. Although the pair have undeniable star power and seem to be having fun, their eyes were likely focused more on the paycheck than on the superficial script which lacks the witty exchanges of classic screwball comedy. Also appearing for the money is a talented supporting cast that includes Viola Davis, Peter Sarsgaard, and Paul Dano; unfortunately, none of these gifted performers have roles that stretch their acting skills. With chases, gunfights, and rapid cutting, director James Mangold keeps the film moving at breakneck speed as the cast chases a \"McGuffin\" in the form of a super battery, whose importance is often lost in the sometimes confusing proceedings.Although even the classic screwball comedies stretched credibility, Mangold\\'s film uses CGI to create sequences that are beyond preposterous. At times, Cruise seems to be a super-hero with supernatural powers; his close encounters are unbelievable even for a Batman or Fantastic Four. As the complicated plot unfolds, the characters\\' motivations seem to shift, and the audience is kept guessing as to who can and cannot be trusted and who is working for whom. The action, light comedy, and appealing performers will hold viewer interest throughout, although, like cotton candy, this fluffy piece will fade from memory before the closing credits finish rolling.', 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Fluffy Action Comedy with Appealing Cast'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1013743', 'movie_title': 'Knight and Day', 'review_body': \"I mean this movie was never going to win any awards, but that doesn't mean it's not a hell of a good time.

It\\'s a pleasant diversion, a fun time at the cinema that doesn\\'t ask a lot of of it\\'s audience and offers an enjoyable ride. We\\'ve seen it all before, but it worked pretty well then, and it works pretty well now.June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is an average perky blonde romantic comedy heroine who runs into the charming and mysterious Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the airport, and is sucked into a series of misadventures when Roy turns out to be a secret agent fighting rogue elements in his own agency . . . or maybe HE\\'s the rogue agent . . . It depends on who she listens to. there\\'s a mysterious device called the Zephyr that Roy is either protecting or trying to steal. All of this is fairly predictable, and, again, nothing new. But director James Mangold (\"Copland\", \"Walk the Line\", \"3:10 to Yuma\") always knows how to make a film play, and his skills haven\\'t deserted him here. His pacing is brisk and fun, and he stages some terrific action (including one sequence from Diaz\\' point of view that did feel genuinely new).Of course, this is a star vehicle, and whether you enjoy it will depend a lot on how you feel about Tom Cruise. Dismissing his personal life as utterly irrelevant, I find him to be a solid and dependable actor who does action better than almost anyone in Hollywood. And, here, he gets a rare chance to flex his comic muscles, and hie\\'s quite funny (though too much of the best material is in the trailer). Diaz is pleasant, but tries a little too hard to be cute.

I really liked it. For me, I considered it more of a comedy, rather than a thriller. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have great chemistry, and did wonderful line deliveries of several running jokes. Their facial expressions, non-verbal actions, and then their unique line delivery - just made everything fit together into a delightful comedy. You will enjoy yourself and laugh out loud. Tom Cruise does a great job of reminding us why we like him as a performer and actor. (Recently, I think too many of us have been side-tracked by his off-camera non-PC comments and antics; so it\\'s good to get back to the basics, that he really is a wonderful actor.) Cameron Diaz is funny, warm,beautiful, and spunky. I loved the way these two actors interacted with each other. Well done. I know another reviewer here kept dropping \"Oscar award winning\" several times - but for myself, I would not go that far. I don\\'t think this has the emotional depth that you\\'d think of for an Oscar; but nevertheless, I think this is a delightful funny movie that will make you laugh and enjoy an evening out. I recommend this movie. You will feel good.', 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Good comedy with great delivery of lines'}, {'movie_id': 'tt1013743', 'movie_title': 'Knight and Day', 'review_body': \"Jump-starting the Mysterious Plot Summer Season (Knight and Day, Salt, Inception, Piranha 3-D), Knight and Day is quite an interesting thrill ride that's very fresh in the midst of a summer season with very little originality. With the two leads delivering charismatic, fun, and great performances, this movie is propelled by star power, intrigue, and never allowing the audience to be one step ahead of the flick. The twists and turns may have been a little unnerving, and the movie does suffer from being quite vague at times, the overall package is a fun one. Unlike most summer clunkers (there was some robot movie last year that was dismally pathetic, if only I remember the name) this one is forgivable for its flaws because of its style, loose direction, and freshness.Without revealing too much (trust me, predicting the movie from the trailer will do you no good), Knight and Day follows a secret agent (Tom Cruise) that accidentally involves a bystander (Cameron Diaz) in the middle of a crazy fight spanning multiple agencies and multiple countries. Written by Patrick O'Neal, this script is very unique, very refreshing, and at times quite off-the-wall. The story moves very fast, but has time for some character development and character revelations‚Äîeven if they become little blurbs here and there. The only issue is that characters are revealed in such quick and awkward manners, but it might be more an editing issue rather than a writing issue.Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise were perfect for their leading roles here. Cameron Diaz has an undeniable charm that has made her not only a major box office draw over the years, but one of the few actresses that can carry any movie past mediocrity. At the same time, Tom Cruise also has the ability to propel movies with his impeccable charm and subtle timing. So, naturally, with these two together, movie magic is accomplished. Just like in Vanilla Sky (even if the editing and obscurity allowed the movie to collapse), Knight and Day is jump-started and propelled by Diaz and Cruise acting together. Their comic timing is great, and can still deliver the emotions when you need them to. Everyone else did a respectable job, but they consisted of dozens of small roles.The movie however suffers from one major flaw: potential. This movie could have been something very special if it had been given a little more love, a bit more budget, and better editing. James Mangold is heavily varied in his directing resume (Cop Land, Walk the Line, Identity, 3:10 to Yuma) so he has the ability to run an action film (unlike the indie-director of the last James Bond flick). But, the movie does this mildly irritating thing in which it sets up potential action sequences, but skips them entirely. While the movie does offer plenty of action, this irritating directing/editing blunder was done at least three times. The fact that it could have done so much more doesn't distract from the overall quality, but does unveil its potential. With a budget of over $120 million, Knight and Day looks like an action movie that was running out of cash.The action that we do get to see is plentiful, and fun. Plausibility and realism takes a timeout as we get insane chases, dozens of explosions, and plenty of fights. There is very little slowdown, very little time for the audience to breathe. The CGI is sometimes a bit much, but doesn't distract too much from the movie. Adding to the mayhem is the dozens of plot twists and turns, which range from small, to changing the flick entirely. Unfortunately, it seems like it was edited by someone with a samurai sword and too much sugar in his blood.Bottom Line: While it could have been so much more, and could have really been something truly special, Knight and Day is still an admirable movie thanks to its leads---even if age is starting to catch up to them. With a crazy script edited in a crazy manner, this movie is far from your average summer movie, and is a mildly refreshing visual trip around the world. No sequel or remake connections here, as the plot is unique, even if the action is your usual CGI-heavy fare. The directing, editing, and content choices however keep it from truly hitting the big leagues. But if you want something different and sequel-free to watch this summer (without screaming for mercy as the movie continues), then Knight and Day is your flick.

It seemed that every time I was about to think \"when\\'s the next action scene\" the movie would stop the thought with a well timed laugh or another action sequence making me never feel like I was waiting for the story or the action to resume.It was also refreshing to see Tom Cruise play a part that wasn\\'t meant to be almost completely emotionally impotent. I\\'ve never before seen him play a character where his face actually SHOWED such a full spectrum of emotions. Cameron Diaz also runs a gamut of emotional and psychological states as she progresses from the sheltered, Midwestern blonde who\\'s in way over her head to the semi-savvy (albeit awkward) companion/sidekick of a rogue spy trying to clear his name.

When he fails from keeping June from boarding the plane is where the fun begins. While June heads to the airplane bathroom to powder her nose, we find out that the entire plane is full of armed men wanting to arrest and/or kill Roy. Roy takes out the armed men and now warns June that there was a reason he didn\\'t want her to board the plane. Now, Roy and June must join forces and work together to protect a new invention that\\'s so big that even the FBI wants a part of the action. A nonsensical but action packed and fun movie ensues...Within the first 20 minutes of \"Knight and Day\" I knew why people hated this movie. First off, it makes very little sense and its really out there. Don\\'t get me wrong, this is a really fun movie but don\\'t expect to \"get\" it because it doesn\\'t make any sense. The action sequences are over the top, Diaz and Cruise look like they are having a blast the entire time, and the movie is somehow interesting despite the plot making no sense. It\\'s a brainless summer movie with some dark humor tossed into the mix. Not what you would expect from the normal Tom Cruise action flick and therefore why people didn\\'t enjoy it that much.While there are a lot of names in this film, Cruise and Diaz are the main stars and everyone else seems virtually unimportant. Cruise does a great job on this film with playing a wacky FBI rogue agent. He really uses his action star skills along with his comedic skills in this flick. Diaz, besides coming off as a brainless ditz, is fun to watch on screen. She really plays the clueless role in the film well and looks like she is having a ton of fun while doing it. I enjoyed watching her and Cruise because they have some really solid chemistry and know how to play off one another. The supporting cast consists of pretty solid actors although they are underused including Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis.The screenplay for \"Knight and Day\" was written by Patrick O\\'Neill, who hasn\\'t written much besides a television series called \"Dead Last.\" The script didn\\'t lack action nor did it lack comedy, however, it did lack common sense. This movie made no sense and I really had a ton of plot holes. If you watch the movie you will wonder how can they get all these places so fast? How can they avoid being shot so many times? How is there no one flying this plane? How does Cruise jump from car to car when they are going 75 miles an hour? Those are just a few of the questions I have with the film. I also have questions about the plot, which has to do with a high school drop out who invented a top secret energy source that is the size of a battery. Why do so many people know about this? Why is it so valuable? And there are plenty more questions but hey this truly puts the title of mindless action flick to good use.The oddest thing about the film to me was that it was directed by James Mangold. For those who aren\\'t familiar with the name, he is the man who directed \"Walk the Line,\" the western remake \"3:10 to Yuma,\" and the intelligent and underrated thriller \"Identity.\" This movie just seemed like a odd choice for Mangold because he usually does dramas with some light action mixed in. This film was an action comedy and definitely not something Mangold has a lot of experience with. He did a fairly decent job with the film and really helped make sure Cruise and Diaz had fun with the film and looked good doing it.At the end of the day, I wouldn\\'t say I loved \"Knight and Day\" but than again I don\\'t usually love any action comedy. It was completely nonsensical but it was a fun and enjoyable action flick. It\\'s not your typical action movie because it mixed a bit of dark and demented humor. Its plot makes no sense and nothing about the film is serious at all. Everyone is acting goofy and looks like they are having fun working on the film. I liked it but that\\'s because I appreciated it for what it was. People expecting the typical action film will probably not like it as much as they would like and those who want to see it for the comedy aspect alone will probably be a tad disappointed as well. I can see how this had mixed reviews and mixed audience reactions. Its not for everyone but for those who are bored with the typical action film nonsense, you may like this one.

Despite the fact that the film's script went through as many as ten different writers, the final script, no doubt with the director James Mangold having a pretty big influence, is fun and entertaining, despite some typical tent-pole summer release plot contrivances (most notably a crass attempt at playing a plane crash for laughs, and silly plot twist at the end of the film that leads to a corny and stereotypical climax).These weaknesses are largely offset by fun performance of Tom Cruise, who is very good in the role of a darker, shiftier, wittier and a more morally ambiguous version of his Ethan Hunt persona from Mission Impossible. He handles himself very well throughout the film and his character makes for a good foil for Cameron Diaz , who has fun playing a car mechanic version of Cameron Diaz. The trajectory of her character in the film is far too obvious, but despite this there is a lot of fun to be had watching her get there, and the on screen chemistry between her and Cruise is charming and draws the audience along.The plot, as I have already mentioned is hardly original, but despite the aforementioned problems it is pretty impressive for one that has gone through a whole slew of writers. Normally these scripts come out very bad. Director James Mangold is the individual who deserves credit for fashioning the script into an entertaining and satisfying caper film, even if the fate of Peter Sarsgaard (the CIA/NSA type operative sent to apprehend/kill the Tom Cruise character, and who is pretty good in the role) is obvious almost within the first ten minutes of the movie.Action sequences are well handled, (kudos to second unit director Brian Smrz)and the digital visual effects are by and large pretty good, being handled by a variety of different companies. Editing is polished , and Jon Powell's score helps keep the proceedings brisk and enjoyable, and there are subtlety amusing nods to both Bourne and Bond in the music. Director Mangold, as usual, marshals all these elements together with style and panache to produce a slick, fun final product that while hardly original, is very enjoyable and leaves you feeling emotionally satisfied when it is over.This is a film that if you simply allow yourself to lap up the experience, will find it to be a fun and entertaining experience, albeit hardly a profound one.\", 'rating': None, 'title': 'Over the top, corny, but  entertaining'}]\n",

Drawing on a few of his popular plot devices from Lost (flashbacks, a crescendo to the turning point), he sets us up neatly into his little world, where Ethan Hunt is now a man trying to live a normal life. Whilst that scenario may be a hard to buy, this is redeemed by the many action scenes in the film which are each exhilarating. To go into detail would be spoiling it, but let\\'s just say there is an extremely breathtaking sequence involving a fulcrum, an amusing one involving Tom Cruise disguising himself as someone, and lastly, but by no means least a helicopter chase which is utterly awe-inspiring and barely lets the audience pause for breath. All this, and you get a Michael Giacchino score that perfectly blends action, anxiety, fear and anger.The cast in themselves are a treat. Tom Cruise, though not given the most trying of tasks in playing an action hero, does a good job with his usual intensity. In the action scenes, his facial expressions are concentrated and focused and utterly convincing. However, Cruise fails in having any genuine chemistry with Michelle Monaghan, for and the romance comes across as rather bland. This is not aided with the poor writing in these scenes. Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Maggie Q merely look cool as his helpers, and Laurence Fisburne and Billy Crudup successfully bring that edge of moral ambiguity to their characters. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellently malicious as the elusive and extremely dangerous Davian, shining in his lizard-eyed role and bringing some genuine terror to the villain. His scenes aside Tom Cruise are superb, as they practically tremble in tension and quiet hatred on both characters parts.You will go to see Mission Impossible III expecting some grand-scale set pieces, and you will not be disappointed here. Each one of the four is masterfully executed, with a breezy slickness that is both cool and exciting.

Opening with a tense and engaging scene, the step back in time to Hunt\\'s training role was a bit of a blow but it moved past quickly enough. The actual plot is then rolled out and despite being total nonsense from start to finish, is probably enough for those looking for summer thrills. Those looking for more (which, as a fan of the first MI film, I was) will probably not get it because generally the film eschews any detail or sense of intrigue and heads right for the action and spectacle.

It is not a great turn from him but he has certainly improved on the disappointing second film in the series. The cast are a strange mix but surprisingly nobody really makes much of an impression and they almost all come over like mere plastic models in one big special effects shot. Cruise does charming, driven, angry or determined as the story requires but other than that he lacks depth and in this film his charisma only got him so far for me. Hoffman is miscast although I can see why he accepted the role; he has good presence but the material he is given is below him and aside from one or two genuinely menacing scenes, he mostly just shouts. Rhames is so-so but the film doesn\\'t do much with new crew members Maggie Q (who admittedly looked great) and Rhys-Meyers (who has a knack of grating on me in most of his performances, not sure why).

      "[{'movie_id': 'tt0384814', 'movie_title': 'Ask the Dust', 'review_body': '\"Ask the Dust\" has excellent elements that almost come together as a whole.Like \"End of the Affair\" and \"The White Countess\", it surrounds a fraught love affair with exquisite looking period recreation that almost sucks the life out of it. (As with those films, the senior citizens at my matin√©e really enjoyed the period aspect.) Set in a sepia-tinged Depression-era Los Angeles of polluted palm trees, it is populated equally by youthful blond California girls and boys and old people at the end of the continent and their lines, as symbolized by Donald Sutherland\\'s begging boarding house neighbor, like a ghost from his role in \"The Day of the Locust\". What saves the film is the frank dialog and odd sparks between Colin Farrell, as repressed Italian-American writer from Colorado, novelist John Fante\\'s alter ego with the even more ethnically redolent name of \"Arturo Bandini\", and Salma Hayak as a non-stereotyped Mexican spitfire \"Camilla Lopez\". Their repartee about their biases is raw and fresh. Significantly, they are not the usual naive teen lovers, but are adults with mileage who are striving to change the trajectory of their lives. In this discrimination-filled, pre-celebration of the melting pot/rainbow environment (heavy-handedly demonstrated such as by their viewing Ruby Keeler\\'s famous line from \"Dames\" \"I\\'m free, white, and 21.\"), both are trying to make it in a specific image of the American Dream, a non-ethnic one, though we hear very little about their own sense of their ethnic identity. She is even dating a nasty guy named White in the vain hope of obtaining a green card and citizenship.Hayak\\'s character is the easier to understand, as we see her exuberate in vibrant blue moonlight when she feels free with him, especially in vivid ocean scenes (she is absolutely stunning swimming naked), and then in bright light at a seashore idyll. This gorgeous scene gives \"From Here to Eternity\" a run for its money as the sexiest crashing of waves coupling in the movies. Though after all her sexually aggressive seduction efforts, their lovemaking is lit beautifully in the dark but conventionally choreographed as I expected her to demand more equality in bed. But then she\\'s already started coughing with Movie Star Disease, even if it\\'s explained more in the plot than usual.Even with his constant florid more than bordering on pretentious narration, sometimes in an exaggerated lower register, of his writing efforts (with the usual scenes of paper being ripped out a manual typewriter as he receives encouragement from H. L. Mencken) that doesn\\'t really thematically integrate into the film until the end, it is harder to understand why it takes so long to get his uptight clothes off despite many importunings. There is an unusually sweet flirtation over literacy, but it seemed more like condescension on his part, especially to help her get citizenship, than sharing with her his love of words. The non-narrated scenes are a relief and are beautiful to look at, as the cinematography of Caleb Deschanel (dad of actresses Zoey and Emily) is consistently lovely.But then Farrell is surrounded by eccentric characters who are all hiding emotional or physical scars until he can face up to his own to find his real writer\\'s voice. Idina Menzel\\'s \"Vera Rifkin\" is a well-educated Jewish housekeeper whose California dreams (or borderline crazed fantasies) are for some reason now focused on being a writer\\'s muse.Surprisingly, there is very little period music, maybe for budget reasons. A prominent and excellent selection is Artie Shaw\\'s version of \"Gloomy Sunday\" which has its own legend of love and death. The score is sometimes intrusive and not as evocative of the clashing ethnic traditions as it could have been.', 'rating': '6', 'title': 'Beautiful Looking Depression Era L.A. Hosts Ethnic Clashing American Dreams and Sexy Romance'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0384814', 'movie_title': 'Ask the Dust', 'review_body': 'Ask the Dust follows the Depression Era story of a rather average writer attempting to be a great one. Set in the new-get-rich town of failed dreams (Los Angeles), the writer is an inexperienced and virginal Colin Farrell, who gradually falls for the uncompromising immigrant waitress Salma Hayek. This is a movie which, like its hero, has great ambitions but fails pitifully in many of them, yet one which can be treasured for its moments of pure beauty and shining rapture in its laboured attempt to become a classic.Colin Farrell\\'s career to this point, after a spectacular rise with the gripping and slightly manic role in Phone Booth, attempted to scale heights which were out of reach (in Alexander, for instance), and then now seems to be developing more methodically with admirable performances such as The New World. In Ask the Dust his casting seems pitched just right, stretching him without making the demands which would need a more experienced actor. Salma Hayek, who is never shy about making a stand for Mexican women (and why not?) slots into her role perfectly. Unlike Farrell\\'s character, an Italian who is nevertheless proud to be American, Hayeck fights on the back foot against the prejudice which she has encountered in real life even to this day. Her starring against Farrell\\'s delicate writer also comes naturally. She has been quoted as saying (in one of her less political or feminist moments), \"I keep waiting to meet a man who has more balls than I do,\" and in our story Farrell has his work cut out to dominate her in true Mexican latino fashion.Farrell and Hayek both being considered among top cinema sex icons, it will come as no disappointment to fans of both that they get into the buff on more than one occasion. One of the best scenes in the film is where Hayek challenges him to show her how to \\'ride a wave\\' one night by moonlight. He bluffs it manfully, not admitting it is his first time in the sea, until she plays a practical joke to pay him back for pretending to have had a heart attack in her restaurant. The colours of the ocean are shot with memorable skill as the two of them out-dare each other (even though she later teases him for being afraid to show his penis on the beach). The director cleverly avoids falling into romantic comedy by using dramatic tension and the love-hate of their unconsummated affair. When the two of them finally do have sex, the turn on is not so much Farrell\\'s heaving buttocks or Hayeck\\'s naked chest \\x96 it is the fact that their emotions, that they have struggled with for so long, finally succeed in speaking each other\\'s language.Other gems include times when translation deliberately falls between the cracks. \\'\\'It\\'s not \\'grew in me\\' but \\'grew on me\\',\\'\\' says Farrell, corrected her stumbling attempts at English (after asking her if it was love at first sight). She however makes a careful metaphor, saying how he grew inside her like a child. Sadly such moments are all too few and far between in this two hour movie. Dedicated cinephiles, or older generation moviegoers that have patience for a slowly developing tale, will wear the more pedestrian scripting and direction that fills the large spaces in-between, but such shortcomings will deny the film wider audience appeal in spite of its stars\\' charisma. Any poetic message element on the race and immigration theme ( . . . happiness is that you can be in a place where you are secure, and fall in love with whoever you want to, and not feel ashamed of it) is not backed up with any clarity of thought in the script (Farrell justifies his American-ness by youth and love of his country, throwing ageism in to replace racism); and the pot-shots at marijuana (if you will excuse the pun), which Hayek uses partly, we suspect, to ease her illness, are so politically incorrect as to be laughable outside of the \\'great United States\\'. The overall message is similar to that erronous belief of George W Bush - that people of other (especially poorer) countries, simply aspire one day to be as great and wonderful as Americans. Salma Hayek may believe this role could help fight for the recognition and equality for all peoples, but it is unlikely that many outside of modern misguided America will see it that way. Like its protagonist, we can only hope that such promise and talent can somewhere blossom into greater writing that here witnessed.', 'rating': '6', 'title': \"A film that is more than Farrell's buttocks, but not quite the great classic it aspires to be\"}, {'movie_id': 'tt0384814', 'movie_title': 'Ask the Dust', 'review_body': 'I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Towne give a talk in Toronto, in which he mused on his long and (mostly) illustrious career.

Farrell takes up the role of Arturo Bandini, an Italian author living in a cheap motel in Los Angeles, while Hayek plays a Mexican waitress, Camilla, who wants to marry an rich American for a better life. Life seems to be the same for them, until they met each other in a caf√© where Camilla works. Arturo was inspired by Camilla, which leads him to wrote more stories, and at the same time, making him realize who he loves eventually.Towne brought out the lives and problems of Arturo and Camilla well, where a young author will never spare much thought on how will he survive tomorrow by spending lots of money on luxury after he gotten his pay, while she will do anything to get herself married to an American for a better life.Ask the Dust also brought out one point faced in the previous century: racism. Camilla was despised by the Americans for she trying to get herself hooked up to an American for a better life where she is a Mexican. Somehow, it was described in brief, rather than a main idea in a whole story.It is not often that the audience would get to see Farrell playing a sentimental role in his acting career. While playing a bisexual trapped in between the love of his homosexual best friend and his best friend's female roommate in A Home At the End of the World (2004), Ask the Dust gives Farrell a greater chance of exploration of a romantic and sentimental man. Hayek, on the other hand, was given a fair share of appearance in the story. Not really the best among her previous films, but she makes the story alive. Keep a look out for the scene where both Farrell and Hayek swims in the beach nude, which is one of the attraction of the film, where this scene starts their romance.Veteran actor Donald Sutherland appears as a special appearance rather than a supporting role, where he plays Hellfrick, Arturo's neighbour. Not much room was given to Sutherland, for his role was too redundant, where he appears less than 15 minutes in the whole film.In all, Ask the Dust has not failed that badly, and it was definitely worth the 8 years wait from Towne.\", 'rating': '7', 'title': 'Love across the boundaries'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0384814', 'movie_title': 'Ask the Dust', 'review_body': 'Given the history of the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through.

While the story is a bit clumsy and self-indulgent with so many sidebars that the momentum of the movie gets bogged down in the telling, there are enough fine attributes to make it a recommended evening of reminiscence about Los Angeles, the City of the Angels in the 1930s.Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) narrates the tale of a lad from Colorado with one published story in a magazine edited by H.L. Mencken who moves to Los Angeles' Bunker Hill apartments to write his big novel. The city of LA has never seemed so strange as it seems with Caleb Deschanel's magnificent photography outlining a city filled with dust blown miscreants - people with dreams at varying stages of dissolution. Arturo quickly becomes penniless, is pestered for rent by landlady Mrs. Hargraves (Dame Eileen Atkins) and for handouts by drunkard Hellfrick (Donald Sutherland), and still a virgin he plies his vision as a writer in a local caf√© where he encounters the beautiful Camilla (way too much of a play on the character of Dumas' 'Camille'...). The two play a battle of wits and insults to cover their apparent infatuation with each other: Mexican Camilla is looking for a wealthy 'white man' to raise her out of her illiterate station and Arturo is looking for a sexual encounter to spur his writing.During their extended 'courting' Arturo is vamped by Vera Rivkin (Idina Menzel), a Jewish housekeeper with grossly deformed legs who dreams of a man who will call her beautiful, and in a touching encounter Arturo displays the kind vulnerability lying under his rather callous and naive exterior.Arturo and Camilla at last connect, and in a Laguna beach house they fall under the spell of love, a state that ends tragically, like the dust from the desert winds burying all hopes of the people of Southern California.The story is a bit clunky and the dialogue feels forced at times but it is always a pleasure to see the work of Farrell, Hayek, Atkins, and Sutherland. The true beauty of this truly beautiful film is in the atmosphere and the mood captured by Towne and Deschanel. Their work offers a mood piece that forgives some of the awkwardness of the threadbare story and shows off the actors well.

Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but there are much worse ways to spend two hours.The film is set in Depression era Los Angeles and the attention to period detail is exceptional, 1930s L.A. brought brilliantly to life. Colin Farrell plays writer Arturo Bandini who is struggling to find inspiration that will allow him to sell some stories for some desperately needed cash. He also struggles with the prejudice he faces due to his Italian heritage. But while Italians may be looked down upon in this time and place they certainly have it better than the Mexicans. Enter Salma Hayek, playing Camilla, a waitress whose goal is to improve her standing in life by marrying a wealthy white man. But maybe just any white man will do if it allows her to become a citizen. Anyhow, Arturo and Camilla meet and although they seem to be an obvious mismatch they inevitably fall for one another. And so off we go, following this relationship which at first is rather awkward but as it evolves...well, actually it's still pretty awkward. Having to deal with prejudices, both those of outsiders and their own, was always going to make this relationship a difficult one. But the pair make it work. More or less. As you watch the two live out their cycle of coming together and drifting apart and coming together again you get the sense the film is at times just standing in place and not really moving forward. The story does drag at times but in the end it works. Barely works perhaps but it does work.Probably the best thing the movie has to offer is its stunning cinematography and period detail. But nice visuals are never enough in a film, you need the story to go with it. And the story here is passable, which is about the best that can be said for it. It never really grabs you but the movie does just enough to hold your interest. Farrell and Hayek are fine in their roles, with Hayek certainly having the Mexican spitfire role down pat by now. Donald Sutherland and Idina Menzel portray a couple of rather unique characters and do a good job with them but those roles are little more than extended cameos. For the most part this film is left to Farrell and Hayek to carry. And they do the best they can with a story which, while certainly not riveting, is interesting.

'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other.

I must confess I did read a couple of newspaper reviews when this film was first released in the UK, - they weren't particularly favourable but they did highlight the Robert Towne/Chinatown connection, - but I forgot all about it until I visited Italy for a weekend holiday in July. As I was passing a cinema in Verona, I was attracted by a couple of very attractive stills...for Ask The Dust. I decided to find out a bit more about the film when I returned home. After doing this, I felt it would be deserving of a screening at our little venue and I booked the film as soon as it was made available to the non-theatrical circuit. I eventually showed the film last night and I believe this was the first public showing in Leicestershire. I fully endorse the comments of others before me, - the lighting, sets, period sense and cinematography are absolutely marvellous, - just literally lovely to look at. I thought Colin Farrell was fine in the central role and am at a loss why he's come in for criticism from some quarters for this performance. Salma Hayek also scores in her sniping early scenes with Farrell and portrays well her character's fears and insecurities at a time when being Mexican was so obviously looked down upon (a very neat selection by Towne for the film excerpt in the cinema scene). Pity our own Eileen Atkins had such a tiny role. Although certainly not a commercial film, it does feature some memorable scenes such as the Long Beach earthquake and the moonlight swim among the crashing waves. And I really liked the idyllic seaside period enjoyed by the two (eventual!) lovers...with the little dog. A good sharp ending in true old-fashioned Hollywood style with a nod towards Camille, which apparently is not in the book, so I've read. After the film finished, I wasn't sure how my audience would react but comments were generally very favourable...and the fairly overt but well-handled sex scene had caused no offence...in fact I did get a couple of middle aged ladies offering glowing expressions with their references to Mr Farrell's appearance in that scene. A very good, quality film, lovingly made by Robert Towne...but one couldn't help thinking with a little more sharpness early on, it could have been even better.

He has made two movies since, and neither was terribly well received, but it was Elizabethtown that went from anticipation to antipathy, marking what seems to be the rest of his career. It didn\\'t help that the reception at the Toronto International Film Festival was so resoundingly negative that Crowe did an emergency cut that drastically reduced the film\\'s length before its wide release.The movie begins with the main character, Drew Baylor, discussing the difference between a failure and a fiasco, fodder for critics who didn\\'t like the film overall. Drew was the lead designer on a new type of shoe that was met with critical anticipation and then derision once it was released, costing the Mercury Shoe Company $972 million. He contemplates suicide and comes up with a plan involving a kitchen knife and an exercise bike when his sister calls with news of his father\\'s death in Kentucky. Setting out to accomplish the one goal of bringing his father\\'s body back to Oregon for cremation and spreading his ashes at sea, he flies to Louisville. On the flight he meets Claire.A lot of the critical drubbing the movie received was over Claire. It went so far as a critic ended up coining the term \"Manic Pixie Dreamgirl\" in direct response to this film. I\\'ll admit that Claire is a problem in the film, even with my interpretation that she doesn\\'t actually exist. She\\'s too available, too cute, too open to Drew too early, and probably written as a real person originally with some scenes that would have undermined my theory about her reality thrown to the cutting room floor. She sees Drew completely alone in coach on an overnight flight, begs him to come to first class, draws him a map to the small town of Elizabethtown, and gives him her number. This is a lot, but she ends up disappearing from the film for a good while, blunting that impact and impression.Drew goes home, and this is where the film works best. Isolated from his father\\'s extended family for pretty much his whole life, he suddenly finds a huge warm embrace to greet him. Cousins, uncles, aunts, and family friends he has only the vaguest of memories of are all incredibly happy to see the son of the man they loved. This feels genuine and infectious, reminding me of when I would go to see my own father\\'s family in Tennessee. There are a lot of people with a lot of implied history who all seem to know Drew\\'s father better than Drew ever did. This ends up matching rather well with Drew\\'s own personal journey dealing with his own failure and the thought that he has nothing to live for anymore. The death of his father provides him a look at new life he had forgotten with years of work. It\\'s not new stuff, but it\\'s solidly told.Drew goes to his hotel and has an all night conversation with Claire after he feels alone and ends up calling everyone he can just to have a conversation. They talk and talk in an extended montage that actually does feel rather sweet as they go from one topic to the next from shot to shot. It implies the sort of easy connection between two people meant to be together. It\\'s nice.The rest of Drew\\'s trip to Elizabethtown is dominated by the final discussions on what to do with his father\\'s body with him standing strong on his father\\'s final wishes for cremation, only to succumb to his family\\'s wishes for burial in Elizabethtown too late to make a difference. The final wake and celebration of the man\\'s life is actually a really nice demonstration of how people mourn in different ways, the centerpiece being Drew\\'s mother using comedy to tell the estranged family why she loved her husband and how she\\'ll miss him. It\\'s odd and sweet.Claire ends up dominating the last half hour of the film when she gives Drew an extremely detailed roadmap that she apparently created in an evening that takes Drew from Elizabethtown all the way back to Oregon, planned to the minute. He follows it, releasing bits of his father\\'s ashes at certain spots, and eventually meeting Claire at the second largest flea market in the world. I\\'m not going to say the movie falls apart in this final half hour, but it\\'s a weak ending. The movie seems to have lost any real focus by turning Drew\\'s attention to a road trip and bits of Southern history like the visit to the hotel where Martin Luther King Junior was murdered. It feels random and out of place. Perhaps MLK\\'s death is supposed to indicate that he died for something, a great victory in the end, with Drew\\'s thoughts of suicide being selfish, but it\\'s not really made clear and feels like an inappropriate way to use the assassination of a beloved figure. There had been bits of talk about Drew having planned a road trip with his father before his death, but it\\'s Claire\\'s voice that dominates the soundtrack, making it more about her than about Drew. I wonder if making it Drew saying the exact same things would have helped refocus the journey on where it should have been.Now, my theory that Claire doesn\\'t actually exist. She interacts almost exclusively with Drew. The only other people she ever speaks to are the engaged couple that are on the same floor as Drew in the hotel. She\\'s never even seen by Drew\\'s family or even talked about with them. Combined with the writing that makes her the Manic Pixie Dreamgirl, an unrealistic ideal of a movie creation that doesn\\'t feel like a real woman, and it seems like a decent interpretation of her character that she actually ends up representing part of Drew\\'s psyche rather than an actual person. She appears when thoughts of perhaps not ending it all start to perk up, and even the last shot of the film seems to underline that a bit. Drew finally gets some more voiceover in the ending, and his last word, \"life\", cuts to him embracing Claire in that flea market. Even in the assumption that she\\'s real, she obviously is meant to represent more than just a woman, but Drew embracing life after his week in Kentucky. Is reading her as unreal a critical cover for bad writing? Maybe, but I do think it works.The movie has its issues, but it is an open-hearted exploration of live after failure.

Was it suppose to be some sort of romantic comedy? In my opinion it really seemed like Crowe wanted to make a film about a son losing his father but the studio said you have to throw in some sort of stupid romance to get more people into the theater. Well, the two sides didn\\'t mix very well together. Even on their own both sides were seriously flawed but it made them even worse when stuck together. As others have mentioned, Dunst comes off more creepy than anything else. The first scene on the plane I kept waiting for her to pull out a knife or something. It was never really clear what the two saw in one another and the stuff over the phone didn\\'t work at all. I also didn\\'t understand what Crowe was going for in the father/son thing. I really couldn\\'t tell if he (the son) was returning home because he cared for his dad or if he just did it so his mother/sister wouldn\\'t have to go.I personally feel it\\'s okay to use music to \"get the point across\" but it\\'s a fine line you\\'ve gotta walk to pull this off. \"Secret Garden\" worked well in JERRY MAGUIRE and \"Tiny Dancer\" worked brilliantly well in ALMOST FAMOUS but none of the music here really paid off. Perhaps it\\'s because I didn\\'t feel any connection between the two leads. As for the performances I really don\\'t think it\\'s too fair to blame them because they didn\\'t have much to work with. I was pleased with Bloom\\'s performance and thought he did a fine job with what he had to work with. His big \"crying scene\" at the end was ruined due to the way it was edited and again, the music. I think we were waiting for his character to breakdown and when it finally happened Crowe kept it in the background. As for Dunst, I\\'m not going to blame her too much because she did have a few charming scenes but again, the screenplay made her out more of a stalker than anything else.GARDEN STATE was a lot better. Every good director has a bad step and I believe that\\'s what ELIZABETHTOWN will be remembered as for Crowe.

There was something about returning, about rediscovering and/or perhaps about first love. Elizabethtown aims higher than most teenage bound movies. The comatose performance of Orlando Bloom makes everyone else appear as if they were high on something. Billy Wilder is always a little bit present in Cameron Crowe's movies and Kirstin Dunst's character is a Wilder character if I ever saw one. I kept seeing the young Shirley MacLaine, or longing for, I should say.

The title didn't seem interesting. I wasn't impressed by some of Bloom's and Dunst's earlier works. But, to my surprise, 'Elizabethtown' is an exception. First it needs to be said that I did not enjoy this movie during first viewing but after the second time, I loved it.It starts off a bit slow in the beginning but that allows the viewer to be acquainted with the characters. The balance between drama, comedy and romance feels a little uneven at first but it gets better with subsequent viewing. Some of the characters of Elizabethtown are a little overwhelming and the humour is dry, which may not be appreciated by many. 'Elizabethtown' is about Drew reconnecting with his past, his childhood and his loved ones, especially his father. It's about him seeing joy in the simpler things of life and perhaps the best things in life are simple. And, it's also about recognizing your love. It's about being happy no matter what. The film beautifully ends with Susan Sarandon's splendid one-woman act that included her tap-dancing. This is followed by an incredible memorable sequence where Bloom's Drew goes on a road trip back home. This sequence is so beautifully executed that I'd even recommend to watch the entire film for that alone. On the technical side, it's very well shot. I liked the framing of the scenes (particularly in the road trip sequence). The cinematography is very good. Like in Crowe's other movies, he's made sure that the soundtrack is great. It is well edited too.Orlando Bloom does very well with a role that couldn't have been easy to play. He does shift in and out with his accent (so does Dunst) but overall delivers a subtle and balanced performance. On first watch, I was irritated by Kirsten Dunst. But during second viewing I absolutely fell in love with her Claire and now see what a good actress she is. Susan Sarandon is terrific and Alec Baldwin is convincing as the jerk of a boss. Judy Greer is great and Jessica Biel is annoying (thankfully she has a teeny role).There's some resemblance to 'Garden State' but while I fell in love with 'Garden State' after first viewing, I felt the same for 'Elizabethtown' after second watch. 'Elizabethtown' really deserves a second chance. Try it and perhaps then you'll see why.

Guy thinks he has girl. Guy wants girl. Guy needs girl. These are the key elements to a romantic movie or \"chick flick\". There have been so many repercussions of this genre that they all end up looking the same and just fading into oblivion. Sometimes, a movie comes along to redefine the genre. Sometimes, a movie will capture the essence of a genre. Sometimes, it just works.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe\\'s latest film Elizabethtown can be considered one of these movies. It stars Orlando Bloom as Drew Baylor, a man who has just caused the shoe company he works for 1 billion dollars for a shoe that doesn\\'t work. After being fired, he prepares to \"deal with life\" but instead receives a phone call that his father has died while visiting his uncle. It\\'s up to Drew to deliver the suit needed for the funeral.On his 3 a.m. flight to Louisville he meets a flight attendant named Claire (Kirsten Dunst) and she just wants to have a conversation. Since she knows the area she helps him out by giving him directions. He is too tired to really have a talk about things but instead just smiles and nods as if everything is all right.In the Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Drew meets the family he never got to know because he lived in Oregon most of his life and was so busy with making the new shoe line. They seem to know all about him yet he doesn\\'t really have a clue as to what is going on, only that they\\'re family...and that\\'s all that counts.Elizabethtown is a great film on many levels. Crowe\\'s script, much like his previous ones, is extremely well written. His use of dialogue is perfect for the situations the characters are thrown into. Another aspect that enhances the script is the cinematography. The way he positions the camera for each scene makes the scene come alive. It seems like so much time was used to think out each individual shot. And to top it all off...the soundtrack. Much like Almost Famous(2000), this movie has a great soundtrack. Each song is perfect for each scene and really transcends the emotion of each character. The road trip that Drew takes could be a separate soundtrack all by itself.The only part of the movie I was anxious about before seeing the movie was the acting of Bloom and Dunst and how they would interact. Fortuanetly it worked out. Bloom was a lot better than anticipated and Dunst seemed very into her role. Probably one of the best sequences in the picture is their conversation on the phone. Their tone of voice, their body language, and their chemistry with each other, even though they are miles apart is as if they were standing right next to each other. Crowe\\'s choice of actors was once again well thought out.The film is a reminder that home isn\\'t necessarily where you live, but where people care about you the most. In this case home is in many places. It can be in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, or in a hotel. Home can even be on the open road. Elizabethtown is a great romance and in some ways a rebirth.

While the acting is fair by the leads (Kingsley, as a man who may or may not be the suspect, plays a tortured soul better than anyone I can think of; Eckhardt and Moss are credible if maybe mis-matched), the script is something of a turn-off. Sometimes it just doesn't make sense, despite a cameo from Robert Towne (uncredited on this site) as a professor who tries to give a little explaining to the FBI agent played by Eckhardt. It's not that the idea of it isn't bad, but it doesn't engage a viewer in a way other thrillers can.What the film has going for it is the direction. This is E. Elias Merhige's third film after his impenetrable art-house film Begotten (arguably one of the most pretentious, deranged, if unique debuts of the 90's) and small success Shadow of a Vampire (a film that gave Malkovich and Dafoe excellent screen time as silent film icons). The style is more than flamboyant- it's madness. Merhige tries his best to get inside the atmosphere that this killer and it's tracker(s) are in, and he succeeds by almost trying too hard. It reminded me of a kind of avant-garde approach to directing one of those HBO thrillers you might catch late at night. While he doesn't do a job as memorable as 'Shadow', and outside of Kingsley and maybe Eckhardt doesn't elicit very good acting, him and Michael (Raging Bull/Taxi Driver) Chapman bring out a technical aspect with tints and angles and shots that aren't too diverting.

The screenplay by Zak Penn was originally finished nine years ago in 1997. A lot of producers thought the script wasn't good enough to be a motion picture, but they liked the idea, or premise, of the film. So, later they tried to find other screenwriters to make another version of the film, but that failed. So nine years (or actually eight years \\x96 it was filmed in 2003) later, they decided since they didn't have any other alternatives, to stick to Penn's script, but make a couple of revisions. That alone, should tell you Suspect Zero wasn't destined to be an Oscar contender.Although, Suspect Zero isn't necessarily a good movie, it isn't a bad movie either. When I walked into the theater on Friday afternoon, I was expecting a messy, incoherent piece of amateur fluff. The only reason I went to see the movie, was because of the brilliant Sir Ben Kingsley (no matter how bad a movie he is in, he gives a good performance). Well, the movie wasn't as jumbled and hard to understand as I would have thought pre-screening, but it was still hard to understand. Even though the story was involving and for the most part entertaining, the screenplay had a lot of holes in it, and there were a lot of scenes that were never made 100% clear. I was expecting Ben Kingsley to carry the movie on his shoulders, but he didn't. That's not to say Ben Kingsley didn't turn in another marvelous character study, but it means Kingsley's character just didn't have a very big part. The film is pretty much Aaron Eckhart's movie, and he does a kind of average job with it. It isn't that Eckart is a bad actor, it's just that\\x85 he isn't really a great actor.The supporting cast of the film is pretty much unnoticeable. Carrie Ann-Moss (The Matrix series) plays the role she always plays ; the strong, independent female with a crush on the leading male. Harry Lennix is funny as the smart ass F.B.I. chief, for the few scenes he is in. The rest of the supporting cast kind of runs together though.The film tries to be too much like 1995's smash hit Se7en, but fails terribly in matching up with the brilliance of David Fincher's masterpiece. However, at the end the film (the last five minutes), the movie achieves great power during the confrontation between Eckhart's ambitious F.B.I. agent, and Kingsley's haunted serial killer. In conclusion, Suspect Zero is about average and somehow manages to spend most of the movie above the level of below average (thanks in part to Ben Kingsley), but I think people should wait for video for this one, and judging by the film critic's reviews of this movie, that won't be a long time at all.

In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-√†-vis humanity.However, it is Ken Watanabe, who steals the show with his mesmerizing and poignant portrayal of Katsumoto, the leader of the last clan of Samurai. His screen presence and delivery is truly amazing and even outshines that of Tom Cruise, which is a compliment in itself. The scenes between Watanabe and Cruise are pure gold, depicting fluctuating feelings of hostility, compassion and camaraderie. Watanabe's intense and powerful performance in which he displays a wide range of emotions, is definitely worthy of the coveted statuette, but the academy never fails to disappoint. Watanabe's brilliant portrayal, not only mesmerizes the viewers, but also convinces the critics of his acting abilities. The tacit adoration between Algren and Taka (subtly played by Koyuki), enormously adds to the beauty of the movie. All this coupled with some brilliant cinematography and a mesmerizing score, makes it a treat to watch and a truly surreal experience.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/\", 'rating': '9', 'title': 'A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pride and Honour'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0325710', 'movie_title': 'The Last Samurai', 'review_body': \"Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.Japan was undergoing a tremendous transformation at this point in time. The United States had with Commodore Matthew Perry's voyage in 1853 opened Japan and cracked her isolationist policy. Over 200 years before the Japanese government had instigated a policy of isolationism in regard to the countries of Europe. It seems as though they looked askance at the Christian missionaries and their activities. They put an almost total embargo on trade or contact of any kind with the west.The Dutch who had very specifically not sent any missionaries to Japan were allowed some extremely limited trading rights in the city of Shiminoseki during this period. So in a limited sense the Japanese kept up with western technological developments. Firearms in fact unlike in the film were in some use in Japan even at the time of Perry's voyage. The Samurai did make some use of them.Cruise is an American Civil War and Indian War hero who's making a living shilling for the Winchester Rifle company. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train a modern army for a whole lot of money and he accepts. In between Perry's voyage and the events of this film, a new Emperor came on the throne. The Emperor Meiji was anxious indeed that his country catch up with the rest of the world and not become a colony of some modern technologically advanced western country. He also did not want to lose sight of old traditions. Duelling advisers competed for his heart and mind in the film and in real life.Cruise's trained troops the first time they're in battle with the professional samurai turn and run. He's taken prisoner, but while in captivity grows to respect and admire Watanabe and what he represents. He also falls in love with a Japanese woman and I have to say his romance made a whole lot more sense than the one John Wayne had in The Barbarian and the Geisha.The final battle scene is impressive, the samurai's own Alamo to put it in American terms. In defeat Saigo Takamori though a rebel became a folk hero in Japan. The Last Samurai is a great story and Americans should see this story about a Japan they only know from World War II films, both good and bad. Tom Cruise should be given a lot of credit for using his star power to bring this story to American audiences.\", 'rating': '9', 'title': 'The Saga of Saigo Takamori'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0325710', 'movie_title': 'The Last Samurai', 'review_body': \"This movie is filled with such excellent performances, beautiful cinematography, well choreographed action scenes, that me not understanding the movie, still liked it anyway.I don't know much about Japanese culture or about the history of Japan during the late 1800s, so I could not fully understand what was happening in this movie.  What impressed upon me is that Nathan Algren, a disallusioned, alcoholic American soldier who went to Japan to train the emperor's troops, was able to find friendship and respect the great samurai, Katsumoto.  These two men, from different countries and cultures, were able to become friends because they are both warriors under their very different exteriors. \\nTom Cruise is so good in this movie, but it is easy to overlook his performance and just think, wow, this man is so hot!  He's even sexy as an alcoholic!  This guy is so good looking that it took me awhile to see him as Nathan Algren, and not just Tom Cruise, sexy superstar actor.  But once I got use to seeing him in this character, I believed him totally.  But Ken Watanabe's emotionally, intense performance, totally blows away Tom Cruise's performance.  One can't help but grow to respect this samurai who opposes the western influence in Japan and wants to retain the samurai way of life. This japanese actor is terrific!  I hope to see him more in American movies. Even if you don't care for historical movies, you should still go just to see the performance of Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise.I won't go into the plot.  I think everyone has a pretty good idea of what the plot is.  I just have to say, I don't see anything wrong with the japanese emperor trying to modernize Japan by associating with the Western powers, and I don't understand why Katusomoto is so against that.  That's the one major problem I have with this movie, is that I don't understand enough of the politics during that time in Japan.  Otherwise, this is a pretty great action flick and I enjoyed it immensely.\", 'rating': None, 'title': 'Excellent performances, especially by Ken Watanabe!'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0325710', 'movie_title': 'The Last Samurai', 'review_body': \"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven.

At the time, Japan had just overthrown the Shogunate and gone back to Imperial rule in a process known as the Meiji Restoration.

What I wanted to shout out after watching this movie was, \"Thank you Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick!!\"From a Japanese viewer\\'s point of view, it is evident that the story is all fiction, inspired by what actually happened. We all know there really was no American who stood for the final samurai rebellions, nor was there an American who took sides of the government. The movie also has its clear flaws if one looks at the details (e.g. there would never be any palm trees in the forests of mainland Japan, the wife of a samurai would never wear such heavy western make-up, the samurais would never be so fluent in English, etc). However, these issues are never irritating, as we could always sense a very strong, pure and innocent message coming from Tom and Ed, which I felt as a message coming from certain caring and intelligent American individuals to the nation of Japan and the Bushido (Samurai) spirit which still continues to live and influence our Japanese culture and our Japanese way of life.It is no wonder American viewers have mixed feelings about this movie, partly unaware of (and lacking true interest in) the history of Japan and partly noticing the similarities between this movie with other movies made in the past. From my perspective, however, being a Japanese national born and raised in Japan and knowing the dramatic history our country has gone through, I could not help but cry feeling the respect and sympathies coming from a very successful movie star (Tom) and movie director (Ed), bothering to spend a \"Hollywood Budget\" on what is a very \"personal\" story for the Japanese. It is the fact that this film was made by Hollywood which makes this film all the more important for Japan, as it would have been just another corny self-appraisal film if created by the Japanese themselves.Again, we know this is all fiction inspired by a true story and can\\'t escape its small flaws, but I love the film all the same, and would like to thank from the bottom of my heart, Tom, Ed and others who deserve credit for thinking of creating this film in the first place.I don\\'t think a film of this nature would ever be able to receive an oscar (as I can imagine how difficult it may be for an average American viewer to appreciate the true and deep meaning of this film, not being Japanese), but I believe this is a film which should deserve some kind of a \"Thank you\" award from Japan.

And Warner Bros put me through TORTURE to see this pic - changes of times AND locations, over and over.  I felt like was on an survival test, an unbearably annoying treasure hunt over weeks and was frankly ready to give it a negative review (which I\\'m writing on behalf of a publication).  However, I found the movie truly and unequivocally remarkable and cannot contain my review in 350 words.First, the experience was powerful.  Edward Zwick was a masterful director. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  The action, sets, scenery and story - even the dialogue - were riveting.  Clearly, a ton of historical and cultural research and care went into the script, sets, costumes, casting. They didn\\'t just Hollywoodize Kurosowa\\'s \"Seven Samurai\" as a Tom Cruise vehicle.  Nor was it Dances with Wolves or Seven Years in Tibet, two PC-preaching pics of yesteryear.  It was a lot more like Braveheart meets Seven Samurai with elements of inculturation a bit reminiscent of Wolves and Seven Years.Rarely does a movie have excellent acting across the board, but all the Japanese actors were outstanding, and the Americans and Europeans were excellent ... Tom Cruise was at the top of his game.  His Independence Day angst combined with his moral nobility in A Few Good Men and The Firm. Ken Watanabe as co-star exemplifying bravery, wisdom and nobility was outstanding.In spite of this historical epic being \"in vogue\" at present, there were surprisingly few clich√© story elements.  Even the requisite (American-made movie) romance with Take (Koyuki in this role was wonderful) furthered the cross-cultural elements of the plot in such a way that neither culture was violated - and above all the `chemistry\\' was discreet in Japanese fashion, taking a necessary backseat without overshadowing the main story line, actually adding richness to the process of \"going native\" for Captain Algren (Cruise).  The subplot went far beyond an added market draw.  Very tasteful and artful scriptwriting, with many colorful, developing characters.\\nThe thrust of the film was the Western-Japanese cultural divide, differing concepts of value and valor and the political issues surrounding Japan\\'s efforts to \"Westernize.\"  [cross-cultural studies have become a cinematic trend: Lost in Translation, Beyond Borders, The Missing, Japanese Story, etc.]  Where most of the other films fell short (and The Statement was an abomination], this film succeeded brilliantly.  The differences between the two cultures were considered and portrayed without completely bashing one (except in the political arena, but even there, the Japanese seemed to be inviting their own downfall, in many ways).  There was no simple scapegoat or cultural domination message.  The American Civil War captain, Nathan Algren (Cruise) goes abroad as not only a war hero but also a cross-cultural and linguistic expert.  Being in Japan, (at first as a mercenary hired to train Japanese in Western ways of war), he takes on the study of the people and their language.  Although Algren\\'s sometimes superhero abilities are a bit of a stretch at times, taking the native language seriously is unique in American filmmaking (and American culture, hence our lowly reputation when traveling).  Usually the American walks into the foreign scene and the pic automatically shifts to all-English.  I was truly grateful to find the dialog half in subtitles because half the characters were Japanese - and Algren was speaking with them.  Secondly, this movie honors both cultures for their recognized strengths, even in their distinctiveness.  For example, when the woman who is hosting Algren (in captivity) makes dinner, he helps her.  \"Japanese men don\\'t do these things,\" she tells him.  \"But I\\'m not Japanese,\" he says (in Japanese).  Algren is not ashamed to uphold his homeland customs (although this was 1876... pre-sensitive 90s man era, long before women\\'s lib let alone men entering kitchens) when his own cultural customs or inclinations are ways of caring rather than domination. Another and more important example:  Algren demonstrates American resilience and perseverance when he rises again repeatedly after defeat.  This baffles the Japanese who are accustomed to falling on their swords in shame after defeat, for them a noble death.  In these and many other ways, the Japanese Samurai (especially Katsumoto, Watanabe\\'s character) and Algren learn to appreciate each other\\'s ways.  In many respects, the film moves past the usual PC party line [of Dances with Wolves, Seven Years in Tibet and most others of similar ilk out of Hollywood] and reflects on the beauty and dignity in the midst of difference between the two worlds, and how much they need to learn from one another without money or domination as a motive. The dignity of the young Emperor Meiji finding his own cultural center, at the end, was especially moving.  Overall, the film had depth and substance with brilliant work in almost every area of production and performance.

The film stars Tom Cruise, who also co-produced, as well as Ken Watanabe, Shin Koyamada, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly. The film\\'s plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, and on the westernization of Japan by colonial powers, though this is largely attributed to the United States in the film for American audiences.Set in Japan during the 1870s, The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a respected American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country\\'s first army in the art of modern warfare. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade- friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him. The sound in movies are broken into three basic categories of sound. They are dialogue, sound effects and music. As stated, dialogue, sound effects, and music require careful balancing to serve the story; because of this, each category is typically recorded separately and mixed together during the final editing process (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).The movie is consistent with its storytelling method. Of course, I love the reference to one of the greatest last stands in history as it foreshadows an epic, final battle. Next, Algren helps Katsumoto devise a strategy where the Samurai can get close to the soldiers so they can use their swords and neutralize the advantage of guns. The movie\\'s title foreshadows a tragic denouement, but that in no way lessens The Last Samurai\\'s impact. The film is in many ways about the clash between the old ways (those of the samurai) and the new (those employed by the American-trained troops). While history makes the results predictable (six decades later, a thoroughly modern Japan would attack Pearl Harbor), it\\'s our involvement with the characters and their situations that energizes the experience of sitting through this movie. The historical context may be established, but we don\\'t know what happens to Nathan, Katsumoto, Taka, and others.The dialogue itself is the requirement for most movies. Without the dialogue, the story and the plot cannot come to conclusion. The dialogue helps shape the mood, the direction, the balance of any movie that the audience is watching. It is also important to note that emphasis on certain portions of the dialogue, whether it be change in tone, pitch, or sped up and slowed down, the dialogue can change the mood of any movie. If done correctly, it will make an excellent companion to the music and the sound effects of that specific film. (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011). As he walks among the people, there is very little dialogue, but many scenes of the beautiful Japanese countryside. This is the perfect place to put music to help the audience appreciate the beauty that he is discovering for the first time. As stated in our text, \"with the advent of sound, music became a basic element of constructing a movie, as essential an element as lights and cameras\" (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-last-samurai-2003Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C.

The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox', 'rating': '9', 'title': 'Spellbinding'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0325710', 'movie_title': 'The Last Samurai', 'review_body': 'A note for the uninitiated: this is not Braveheart (1995) in a different guise. Instead, this is a far more sophisticated piece of art, a film that makes history a subject well worth investigating further. With the Last Samurai, director Edward Zwick has created a film perfectly showcasing heroism at its fullest. Tom Cruise stars in (arguably) his finest role to date, as the American Captain Nathan Algren, who is captured by the samurai warriors he is training the Japanese army to defeat. At first reluctant to explore the new world he has been pulled into, Algren slowly begins to see that perhaps these samurai are not the \"barbarians\" that he has been led to believe they are. Usually when you see a Tom Cruise film, the mega-star status shines through instead of the character he is playing, but in the Last Samurai Cruise has presented himself admirably, as the viewer is sucked into the samurai world with him. He at once shows strength and bravery, but also compassion and a weakness of spirit, not to mention a fine sense of humour, usually directed at his samurai guard, \"Bob\". Algren\\'s development from a drunken waste to a samurai himself is utterly compelling, and comes through at its best when the samurai village is attacked by ninja\\'s, and Algren instantly decides to side with his captor\\'s leader, Katsumoto.The film wastes no time getting to the point of Algren\\'s capture, but when he gets to the samurai\\'s village, the film takes its time showing the samurai\\'s way of life, and many people may think that this is where the film begins to drag, but this is not the case. Throughout much of his time in the village Cruise says very little, but his silent wonderment at the samurai life gives off a dramatic effect unreachable by many effects-driven blockbusters, and it is this part of the film that Zwick shows off his talents as a director. However, the real star of the show is Ken Watanabe\\'s samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is the perfect actor to play a character driven by the need to keep up the ways of his ancestors, and to stop Japan being pulled into an industrial revolution, however futile this may be. He is the true embodiment of the samurai code, never giving up, and sticking to his principles even in the face of certain defeat. Watanabe is a hugely convincing actor, making you want to root for him all the way, despite the fact that the samurai are actually fighting against the emperor.This film is an action film, though. Whilst there is plenty of drama, Zwick proves himself to be an admirable action-director, whether handling the large battles of the samurai versus Japan\\'s army, or the more intimate one-on-one fights that Algren is involved in during his time in the samurai village. The screenplay is very well written; not surprising as it was co-written by John Logan, the writer for the immensely popular Gladiator. Cruise is well backed up by the supporting actors, including Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall, in a film that has been carefully crafted rather than slapped together, producing a film that, despite its relatively unimpressive box office success, is still one of the finest mainstream films that has come out of America for a long time.

However, the army that Algren had been training encounter the Samurai before their training has been completed and the army end up being overpowered and defeated by the highly trained Samurai. Algren is the only survivor of this battle and in recognition of his bravery and determination Katsumoto spares his life and invites him to stay with the Samurai. During his time with the Samurai, Algren learns quite a bit about their culture and eventually embraces it and fights back against those that had originally hired him to overthrow the Samurai.Tom Cruise's performances and films tend to vary greatly in quality so I do tend to approach a lot of his films with caution. I can safely say that this is one of his better films and also one of his better performances. Cruise is well-known for bringing a sort of smug arrogance to a lot of his roles and he definitely brings some of that to his role as Captain Algren - although there's only a whiff of it here rather than full on smugness that we've seen from him before. Director and screenwriter Zwick gives Cruise a character he can really sink his teeth into - Algren is obnoxious and rude at the start and shows very little respect for his employees. He's the same with the Samurai at the start, but I think the difference is that the Samurai show him respect and allow him to embrace their culture. The general saying in life is that to 'gain respect you must first give respect' and I got the feeling that this was one of the messages contained within this film.The first 20 minutes or so of this film are slick and fast-paced, but the momentum does slow down where Algren is staying with the Samurai. Although the pace slackens at this point the film never becomes boring and Algren's narrative and the exploration of the Samurai culture were interesting enough to keep me involved with the story. The only criticism I have with this aspect of the story was when the ninjas attacked the Samurai - I just didn't see the point of it and it also seemed to add nothing to the story, but this really is a minor criticism.Much like Seven Samurai, The Last Samurai is a slow-burning film that rewards the viewers patience with a spectacular closing act that is epic, clever and heart-breaking. Technical aspects of the film are also superb most notably the beautiful Japanese scenery and wonderful cinematography.Clearly there are some politics involved here, but the politics are side-lined for the most part to make way for an interesting story about one man identifying more with an alleged 'rebellion' group over his own people. I've no idea how much of this story is true - it certainly references real life people such as General Custer and real-life events such as the battle of little bighorn, but never says anywhere that it's based on a true story. Truth be told, it doesn't matter to me whether the story is true or not because the film has a good story, it's moving at times, it's beautiful to look at, has some wonderful performances and to top it all the final battle is fantastic. Therefore it's very much worth seeing on its own merits.\", 'rating': '8', 'title': \"It's a long film, but the rewards are definitely here for the patient viewer\"}, {'movie_id': 'tt0325710', 'movie_title': 'The Last Samurai', 'review_body': \"Glad to know how samurai lived and loved bravely.

      "[{'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': \"The public-at-large loves a good scandal, and in 1998, the scandal involving Stephen Glass was a pretty darn good one. It turned out that Glass, a young prodigy who was writing for several magazines, but primarily for the prestigious 'New Republic' ('the in-flight magazine of Air Force One') had fabricated some or all of 21 of his 41 well-received stories; a scandal that rocked the journalism world and was picked up by the general public and was later repeated with Jayson Blair. 'Shattered Glass', co-written and directed by Billy Ray examines this true-life story, with Hayden Christensen playing Glass and Peter Sarsgaard as his editor, Chuck Lane. I have never seen Christensen's work in anything else until this point, and I was impressed by his acting chops. He was able to handily express Glass's desperate need for acceptance and his compulsive and repulsively cunning nature so well that the viewer, when faced with the dilemma of how to feel about this man, can only watch numbly as the train wreck that becomes his life careens further out of control. Sarsgaard, as usual, is fantastic as the fair and decent-minded Lane, the editor who first tries to help and protect Glass, but then, after digging deeper, finds that there is a lot more to the man than sloppy journalism. It is actually surprising to me that 'Shattered Glass' became a film. I remember reading a Vanity Fair piece on Glass back when the scandal broke, and that, and the myriad other articles seemed to be sufficient exposure. The fact that 'Shattered Glass' was released five years after the scandal settled down, and that it is a compelling screenplay and film is a testimony to Ray's (a first time director) talent. 'Shattered Glass' is gut-wrenching in that it is difficult to watch because the viewer knows how deep Glass digs himself, and it's not necessarily fun to watch. 'Shattered Glass' is an intelligent, well-done film and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates that a film doesn't have to be showy in order to make an impact.--Shel\", 'rating': '7', 'title': 'An impressively compelling film'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': \"Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen) is a young ace reporter for The New Republic. The magazine is heralded as the inflight magazine of Air Force One. Glass is personable and his stories are fabulously enticing. He expertly weaves his fables with panache. Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) is originally a reporter, but then gets elevated to editor. Chuck is the exact opposite of Glass. He is reserved, and stickler for the work. As a reporter, he struggles to keep up with Glass's flashier stories. As an editor, nobody trusts him. When Glass's article on computer hackers is questioned by an online publication, things spin out of control.The true story is shocking. And the movie portrays it with realism. This is probably Hayden's greatest performance. He has the boyish charm that makes all those lies believable. But he also has a twitchy quality about him. It's also believable that he made up all those lies. This is infinitely better than the Star Wars debacle. Peter Sarsgaard has that quiet intensity that is perfect for his role.The only thing I didn't like was the older lady at the end when she says that if only they had pictures.... That's not necessarily any solution. Pictures can be doctored just as easily. And pictures can distract any fact checkers. I don't know if somebody actually said that in real life. But it's one line that I'd rather cut out.I think it's too bad that Hayden Christensen will always have the Star Wars movies hanging over him. It overshadows some good work in this movie. He needs to find these types of roles that can challenge his acting skills.\", 'rating': '8', 'title': 'Hayden actually great'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': \"One of the unsung and unheralded movie treasures of 2003, 'Shattered Glass' tells the fascinating story of Stephen Glass, one of the top reporters for The New Republic in the 1990's, who rocked the media world when he had to finally confess that he had fabricated many of his stories. 'Shattered Glass' plays like a modern Greek tragedy, centered on a man of great talent and potential brought down by his own internal weaknesses. Glass was only 24 when he fell from grace; prior to that, he was a hot shot reporter who, in the highly competitive world of high stakes journalism, kept looking for that little added edge to make his stories saleable. For a number of years, Glass managed to slip those stories past his editors and fact-checkers without being discovered. However, in the spring of 1998, his world came crashing down around him after an internet magazine became suspicious of a story he had written about a computer hacker who, it turns out, never actually existed.'Shattered Glass,' which is based on an article by Buzz Bissinger, succeeds as both a complex character study and a top notch thriller. The film never gives us any easy answers as to just why Glass put his journalistic integrity and career on the line by perpetrating these frauds. As portrayed in the film, Glass is a paradoxical mixture of both arrogance and insecurity, a smooth manipulator who can charm and sweet talk his way into getting people to like and trust him while at the same time employing those same skills to get himself out of tough situations. Eventually, however, the act runs out of steam and he is exposed for who and what he really is. Yet, who, indeed, is he? Is Glass simply a pathological liar? Is he a stressed-out, overworked 'kid' trying desperately to keep his head above water in the cutthroat world of professional journalism? Is he merely a smooth-talking, unethical charmer who knows what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it? Could it be that he is some or all of these things at the same time? The fact that the film never fully answers these questions is what pulls us so deeply into the drama. Moreover, Hayden Christensen gives a superb performance as Glass, making the character both smarmy and vulnerable, repellant and sympathetic all at the same time. In addition to Christensen, the film is filled with brilliant, subtle performances by Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny, Hank Azaria and many others. Superbly written and directed by Billy Ray, 'Shattered Glass' is one of the most suspenseful films of recent times, far more gripping than most so-called thrillers because the film is dealing with real-world issues of integrity and ethics. We watch with morbid fascination the slow unraveling of a man's 'crime' and character, as Glass becomes more and more ensnared in a web of his own making. The step-by-step process by which a promising young man's true nature is uncovered, then his reputation destroyed, becomes the stuff of classic tragedy.Although The New Republic eventually recovered from this debacle, the filmmakers do not let the magazine off the hook quite so easily. The thing we are most struck by is how incredibly young the reporters at the magazine were at the time (we are told their average age was 26!). How such unseasoned writers came to play so prominent a part in so major and venerable a publication is indeed one of the great mysteries of the story - and one of the sharpest indictments leveled against the magazine by the makers of the film.'Shattered Glass' is an ineffably sad film, one that makes us mourn the loss of a promising, talented individual who sowed the seeds of his own destruction (he is currently a lawyer). Yet it also inspires and uplifts us by reminding us that men of integrity will almost always triumph over men of little or no integrity in the long run. That's a truism worth remembering in this time of great moral confusion in which we find ourselves living. 'Shattered Glass' is not to be missed.\", 'rating': None, 'title': 'a mesmerizing morality play'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': '...Although Im not sure anyone else would enjoy this. I am on my school\\'s newspaper, and we watched this in my journalism class. I thought it was...pretty decent. This movie doesn\\'t have anything found in a typical Hollywood movie, however. There is no violence, there is nothing sexual, and the biggest thing at stake is a job. The characters are never in any physical danger. A movie centering on journalists that would have a much bigger mass appeal is Russel Crowe\\'s State of Play. I think this was also a better written movie.Still, Shattered Glass is interesting. The story is actually a true one, based on the controversy around a reporter, Stephen Glass, who made up stories and published them in national newspapers. The pace can drag on at times, but that\\'s to be expected, again, because of the complete absence of many Hollywood tent poles.As far as casting goes, I really enjoyed Peter Sarsgaard in this, but I continue to wonder why Hayden Christensen has ever been cast in movies. All I can say for him is that he isn\\'t as atrocious here as he is many other films. And the story about how bad a journalist really can screw up was interesting, interesting enough to cover Christensen\\'s mediocre performance.The film is also fairly surrealistic. It is a very psychologically oriented film. This is not to excess, but Glass is not always \"present\" in his actual life, as he resides in his idealized fantasy. Some of these sequences can add an air of confusion to the atmosphere. There were certain points that left me wondering \"What just happened?\"Shattered Glass, just based on it\\'s concept never had even the slightest potential to become a Hollywood blockbuster. This was still a decent, if flawed movie. In the hands of a more capable director, with a better lead actor, though, it still could have been much better. As soon as it ended, I was left with a feeling of slight confusion. After several more minutes of deep reflection I was able to ascertain what had happened. And while I was completely disappointed with the film as a whole, it still left me somewhat underwhelmed.', 'rating': '6', 'title': 'A must see for Journalists...'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': 'As the subject line above says, I have to admit to an insider\\'s point of view. I was an award-winning investigative reporter and editor working in newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio, and network-affiliate TV. I quit journalism in 1980 in large part because of the ever-increasing number of talent-challenged first-year \"journalists\" who wanted to be the next Woodward/Bernstein, and worse, the willingness of management (especially in local television news) to hire and even promote them. To be honest, however, I would have to add that the low pay, true even at places like The New Republic, was a major factor to an expectant father.So I am sad to say that I completely buy the characterizations presented in this docudrama on Stephen Glass\\' time at that august magazine. The only thing that didn\\'t ring true was that I never met anyone who had the time or inclination to be as considerate of his fellow journalists as Steve Glass apparently was. My wife pointed out that she never met one journalistic co-worker she would spend time with if she had the choice. I would admit that the nicest I knew were, at best, benign. I should add that I was NOT the nicest I knew. Even I didn\\'t like me those days.Getting back to the film, I can\\'t speak to what actually motivated this particular person to fabricate 27 of 41 stories at a very major national magazine. The film suggests that he was too eager to please, and perhaps that is true. But that probably wasn\\'t what motivated Jayson Blair (at the New York Times) or others who have recently been exposed as serial fabricators. Ambition unrestrained by ethics, unreasonable pressure to succeed due to premature promotions, other unknown and perhaps unknowable motivations... they probably figure into these sorts of disasters. But what is certainly true, and given very short shrift by the film, is the role journalistic management plays. To put a rather fine point to it, too many editors do not know how to, or perhaps just don\\'t like to, do their jobs.Too many times I see on national news programs statements treated as fact that somehow I can\\'t believe were ever fact-checked. Just today I saw an episode of HBO\\'s RealSports where an amazing statistic was mentioned: that a certain percentage (I believe about 4% but wasn\\'t taking notes) of people who start playing poker as young kids go on to have gambling problems. I instantly asked myself: where did those statistics come from? Poker playing among the very young (pre-college-age) was probably a fairly rare thing before the past couple of years. How would they know today that 15 years ago such-and-such a percent would later have problems? If you understand statistics you would know that you can\\'t find gambling addicts now, ask how many played poker as young kids, and extrapolate any useful estimate of future danger (100% of alcoholics once drank socially, but that doesn\\'t mean 100% of social drinkers go on to become alcoholics). So did some editor at RealSports check this out? Why don\\'t I believe someone did?In writing this six-paragraph movie review, perhaps to be seen by no one, I checked things over time and again for accuracy. Oops: I misspelled Jayson Blair; fix it. Spelling errors no one cares about in this Internet-only story: check the entire piece in an external spell checker. In all I made almost two dozen changes. No one reading this will notice, or if they do, care. But that is what I do because I once was an editor.It is this instinct for distrust of EVERYTHING anyone says or writes, including oneself and one\\'s own work, that I believe is missing in far too many editors today. It is this shortcoming that allowed Stephen Glass, Jayson Blair et al to last so long before being exposed. It is a major weakness in journalism, and the lack of acknowledgement of this weakness is the only fault I found in this otherwise excellent film.', 'rating': '9', 'title': 'Quite believable, says this former investigative journalist'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': 'I still don\\'t know what to really think of this movie. On the one side it\\'s a really made movie, that got well directed and features some fine performances from its actors. But on the other hand it just isn\\'t the most interesting movie ever made because it lacked a certain depth for me. For instance this movie doesn\\'t really explain the things why Stephen Glass did the things he did. We just never get to know what makes him tick and therefore this movie as a character study and character movie (which this movie obviously is) just isn\\'t effective enough.The movie is perhaps a bit too self aware and ambitious. The movie feels to self righteous at times. It was like the movie had a story and they knew in advance how they wanted the movie to end but somewhat forgot to build up effectively to it and the way the story progresses instead feels very obligatory and also predictable. Basically when you\\'re being objective you\\'ll also notice that the first and the last halve of the movie don\\'t really connect that well and feel quite different from each other. As a matter of fact, halve way through the movie I actually wondered to myself what the point of the first halve of the movie exactly was for the story, since the story really started to take off halve way through.But no it\\'s not a horrible movie or one that I hated watching, it got too well made for that. Billy Ray is a director with potential but he\\'s more a person who gives more priority to his writing. He wrote a couple of screenplays for some big and successful Hollywood production. He\\'s currently working on the screenplay for the \"Westworld\" remake.But what also made this movie such a fine watch was its acting. The foremost reason why this movie didn\\'t became a real box-office success or the reason why this movie isn\\'t really that well known is because Hayden Christensen is playing the main lead. He got criticized a lot for his acting in the new Star Wars movies and he made this movie between \"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones\" and \"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith\". Therefor most people just weren\\'t interest in this movie but in all fairness he is perfectly cast in this movie and plays his role really well. He plays a reporter who is lying to his teeth during the entire movie and he does this very convincing. In the sequences you can tell when he is lying but at the same time you can also somewhat understand why his colleagues still simply believe him and take for granted what he is saying. A great accomplishment from Christensen. But who also deserves credit is Peter Sarsgaard, who perhaps plays the best role out of the movie. Other fine actors such as Chlo√´ Sevigny, Rosario Dawson and Hank Azaria also appear in this movie but I don\\'t know, I just don\\'t feel that there parts are important enough within the movie to really leave an impression.It\\'s a fine enough watchable little movie but I just wasn\\'t really taken by it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/', 'rating': '6', 'title': 'Well made but it lacks a certain depth.'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': 'I really enjoyed watching this.

It is a movie that makes one think about our values, and above all, how low will some people go to get their 15 minutes worth of fame by lying, cheating and taking down the same institutions they are trying to break into.The idea of this picture is based on actual facts, so there is nothing fabricated in it, as we are presented an ambitious man working his way up the editorial ladder. Stephen Glass, is such a person. This is a very intelligent individual who goes to extremes to write fiction and make the reader believe that what he is reading is fact. Heaven help us from the Stephen Glasses of the world.Stephen Glass was the perfect person to be hired by the New Republic, a magazine for the elite. It is a magazine that prides itself in only running text and no pictures. Well, it would have helped the publication to have demanded photographic proof from Mr. Glass, as the receptionist clearly points out at the end.The cast assembled by director Billy Ray for this film is flawless. The work of Hayden Christensen as Stephen Glass, and Peter Sarsgaard as Jack Lane are brilliant. This was an inspired choice as both bring to the film the right tone, complementing one another. These actors will go far, no doubt.The ensemble cast is also very effective.

Obviously the work of an inexperienced director (Billy Ray), it contains a central structural flaw in the screenplay that holds it down: it makes the mistake of telling the story from several perspectives, employing an almost anti-\"Catch Me If You Can\" structure (never revealing the main character\\'s actions as they happen, only showing the impact on others) while at the same time using a highly subjective bookend device which brings us directly into the main character\\'s inner thoughts. The result is slightly uneven, and emotionally less involving than it could have been.The film begins with celebrated journalist Stephen Glass (pretty-boy actor Hayden Christensen) being proudly introduced by his former high school teacher to her journalism class. Glass espouses his knowledge and journalistic philosophies to wide-eyed and hopeful students. At this point, Glass is the main character. We are with him; we hear his thoughts through voice-over and learn his philosophies. So far, so good.But as the second act begins, the perspective changes, and suddenly Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn, excellent) -- who would ordinarily be the antagonist, the man who exposes our hero Glass -- becomes the main character! Suddenly we are with Penenberg, hearing his thoughts and actions as he becomes determined to expose the fraudulent Glass. If \"The Graduate\" had taken this approach, we\\'d have seen Mr. Robinson plotting his revenge on Benjamin Braddock; if \"Easy Rider\" had done it, we\\'d have seen the rednecks planning their ambush before finally killing George Hanson. Thank God level heads (and smart filmmakers) prevailed back then.We are so distanced from Glass\\'s behavior, in fact, that we don\\'t even know if he\\'s lying about his news sources or not -- though most audiences will guess he is making stuff up due to reviews and trailers for the film. But we are never with him when at the moment of fabrication, and don\\'t quite understand his motives.As the second act continues, another character, new editor Charles Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) -- initially a secondary character -- becomes more prominent, eventually becoming the true main character. By the end of the film he wins the approval of the employees who once scorned him. At this point, Hayden Christensen is barely in the film. He has become the opponent -- and not an important one at that. A less radical shifting of perspectives can sometimes work. \"American Beauty\" shows the private goings-on of the satellite characters -- but Lester Burnham is always the main focus, the man whose viewpoint is always uppermost in our minds. Most importantly, these scenes never drive the plot, they merely help set it up or enhance it. The secondary characters are never allowed to take center stage, control the action, or reveal more than our hero does. But throughout most of \"Shattered Glass\" the supporting cast does just that.The action is mainly controlled by Zahn and Saarsgard; Glass merely reacts, defending himself, back-peddling. We never see what goes on outside the office except when we cut to Zahn at his place, or Sarsgaard at home trying to figure things out. All of this might work as kind of a mystery -- leaving the audience to wonder what the hell is going on -- but director Ray begins and ends the film with subjective views of Glass -- and occasionally cuts back to him in the classroom - establishing him as the main character. The other main problem with the film, in my view, is Hayden Christensen\\'s performance. Christensen continues the same monotonous, infantile,lifeless delivery that completely destroyed \"Attack of the Clones\" and didn\\'t help \"Life as a House.\" But here he has added something worse: he speaks so hurriedly and slurred, emphasizing the wrong words, breezing over important ones -- that much of his dialogue is incomprehensible (Lucas evidently curbed this mush-mouth tendency, while novice Ray was not smart enough to do so). Speaking in this trendy, fast-paced manner that many teenagers now favor -- making two-syllable words into one syllable, letting words trail off without enunciating -- is positively disastrous in a movie like this. \"Client\" and \"terror\" become one-syllable words; \"terrorist\" becomes two. \"Then you\\'ll help me?\" becomes \"Thenyulhellme?\" By racing through his lines, Christensen not only diffuses the power of the script, he comes off as a mealy-mouthed, James Dean wannabe -- delivery important dialogue like a speed freak with a speech impediment.Some of Christenson\\'s acting is downright embarrassing, coming off more like a first rehearsal of a soap opera, a script read-through before the acting begins. The awkward dialogue doesn\\'t help. And much annoying soap opera- style character name usage -- a typical problem in a young director\\'s work -- is employed (\"What do you think, Caitlin?\" \"I\\'m not sure, Amy.\") That type of thing. But Christensen almost makes up for his sins by the end, when he\\'s pushed to the brink and appears ready to fall apart. He shows some potential. If only the great studio voice coaches were still around to teach him how to talk.Chloe Sevigney and Melanie Lynskey seem to have jumped onto the same speed freak bandwagon as well, while Zahn, Sarsgaard and Hank Azaria and are all, thankfully, normal -- and real actors. All three are excellent, but Sarsgaard stands out in particular. His work is Academy Award worthy; I would be happy to see him a get a nomination.All in all, not a bad first film.

As an aspiring writer, one of the biggest problems for me (as with all authors, I\\'m sure) is setting up a believable story with realistic characters and motivations, but the trick is being able to do so within the more realistic realm of fiction.With that in mind, then think about this for a moment: A story about a 15 year-old computer hacker who brings a major software company to its knees would make for great entertainment at office meetings or parties. It has a realistic setting and a believable plot, with a kid who hacks into a company\\'s database, and offers his services in preventing others from doing so, but first wants \"X-Men\" #1, a new car, and subscriptions to Playboy and Penthouse. This kid is then hailed as a hero within the hacker community, and he gets to sit back and revel in his newfound fame.Stephen Glass (Hayden Christensen) had this story nailed down pat - characters and everything, but his problem was that he was not a fiction author, he was the premiere writer for an important technological magazine and nearly ran it into ground when it was discovered that he had fabricated more than half of his articles.Make no mistake though, \"Shattered Glass,\" which details Stephen Glass\\' devastating fall from grace when his deception is unearthed by the staffers of a rival magazine, is not at all a pleasant experience. I sometimes had to remember that this was based on a true story, and that a man lied to earn his fame.I have to admit that by the time the credits began to roll, I was almost on the verge of tears, because I was so saddened and angry - saddened because Glass was on the surface, basically a good and well-liked person. I was angry because this well-liked man was also a fraud, and he deservedly got caught when he became trapped by his own elaborate deceptions.The final 20 minutes are the most achingly difficult moments to sit through, as Glass\\' plans come apart at the seams, and we the audience are given front-row seats to his destruction. And we watch as Charles \"Chuck\" Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) sits back and (unsympathetically) bears witness to all of it. He is totally unflinching to Glass\\' pleas to drive him somewhere before he does something terrible to himself, like suicide.It would also help to imagine yourself in Lane\\'s position as an editor, to finally hear that you have been deceived by a kid, a bright kid nonetheless, and then find yourself faced with the difficult task of cleaning up the devastation. You then have to print a formal apology in the next issue of your magazine saying to your readers that they\\'ve been lied to.An effective, powerful film - \"Shattered Glass\" - and I\\'m not sure that I could ever sit through it again.10/10', 'rating': '10', 'title': 'When \"Glass\" shatters...'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': 'My fianc√©e and I were at Blockbuster one night, looking for a movie, and he pointed to a bunch of titles that held absolutely no interest for me. I didn\\'t want to look rude, so I picked the least offensive-looking one, a movie about journalism that looked like something I might be able to at least sit through. The movie\\'s cast screamed \\'Hip! Independent!\\' but I figured if I could browse the Internet at the same time, I wouldn\\'t die watching \"Shattered Glass.\" It started out not-so-promising. I remained on the Internet, and glanced up every now and then to see Hayden Christenson (as reporter Stephen Glass) acting whiny (and delivering his lines in a rather flat voice) and Melanie Lynskey acting the way she always does in movies. Still, something made me keep glancing up, and soon I became engaged in the story of the rather-unlikable Stephen and his adventures at the New Republic magazine.In case viewers weren\\'t aware, we find out fairly soon into the film that Stephen\\'s popular news stories aren\\'t quite what they seem. In fact, he\\'s blatantly making them up ... and the movie really begins to PICK up when a geeky hacker at a rival, smaller (online) magazine notices the inaccuracies in Stephen\\'s latest piece. That hacker and his co-horts make it their mission to set things straight... and it\\'s not long before Stephen has turned from a young, hip reporting Superstar, popular with his staff, to a pathetic, crybaby, excuses-making mess.The actors in this film aren\\'t typically my favorites, but I don\\'t really hate them, either -- and they\\'re in top form here. Surprisingly, the actor I tend to dislike the most (Steve Zahn) is the one responsible for getting the movie going (as the hacker who outs Stephen) and thankfully, he\\'s much less flamboyant than in other roles. Melanie Lynskey and Chloe Sevigny, both reporters and staunch defenders of Stephen, don\\'t show us anything they haven\\'t before, but they\\'re decent and believable. Hayden Christenson, despite his oft-monotone voice, felt whiny and prissy throughout most of the film... but in the end it worked for his loser-ish character. And Hank Azaria manages not to offend as a well-liked editor who gets fired by the New Republic boss in favor of a guy who\\'s not so beloved by the staff.The new editor, Chuck, is played by Peter Sarsgaard -- and he\\'s the actor who impressed me the most in this film. I\\'ve read a lot of gushing reviews of his performance since watching it, and I\\'m actually glad I watched before reading (since sometimes gushing reviews tend to turn me off). But Sarsgaard is excellent here as the stuffy, square Chuck. He, Chuck, knows the staff members resent him; he also strongly suspects that Zahn & co. are right about his star reporter, and Sarsgaard perfectly captures that awkward circumstance of knowing you\\'re unpopular and knowing you have to make the right decision even if that decision will be as unpopular as you are. I doubt if I\\'ll go out and rent all of Sarsgaard\\'s films, but he actually made me wonder more than once \"who is that actor?\" which is rare. I give him props for a job well done! Other than the somewhat-slow beginning, the movie\\'s most noteworthy flaw is that some of Stephen\\'s fantasy sequences seem a bit overdone. However, there\\'s one ongoing fantasy of sorts that might not make much sense at first yet makes perfect sense at the film\\'s close (and nicely coincides with Chuck\\'s status in the workplace).I thank my fianc√©e for pointing to this movie.', 'rating': '9', 'title': 'Surprisingly engaging, with some good performances'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0323944', 'movie_title': 'Shattered Glass', 'review_body': \"This is a brilliant rendering of an all-too-true story of deception and cover-up in modern journalism.

Watching a young, bright, but terribly flawed young man commit slow-motion career suicide that both betrays his friends and endangers their own reputations and livelihood is indeed uncomfortable, but is also what makes this film mesmerizing knowing that it is mostly real.Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Stephen Glass is that of a rather pathetic character whose willingness to not only deceive his readers and colleagues in pursuit of instant fame but also to continue to dig his professional grave ever deeper rather than cop to his fraud. Christensen's performance is convincing and workmanlike but not particularly memorable.The performance that IS memorable - so much that his character becomes the moral center of the film and steals the show - is that by Peter Sarsgaard of editor Charles Lane. Anyone who has been unwillingly thrust into a seemingly premature promotion under unfavorable circumstances (in this case replacing a much-loved editor who's been fired for sticking up for his writers) can immediately appreciate Lane's discomfort. That discomfort, expertly exuded by Sarsgaard, becomes interlaced with panic and eventually anger as he slowly realizes the magnitude of Glass' fraud and his ever-more-desperate attempts to maintain it. While his anger grows, so does his confidence in his own abilities, which is demonstrated with expert subtlety.The film's ability to end on an upbeat note, as the writing staff finally comes to appreciate Lane's predicament and concern for their feelings and reputations, both of which have been damaged by the colleague they've wrongfully defended most of the film, is welcome.The only criticism of this film is that it never really explains what was unique about Glass that made him fabricate stories, sources, and characters on such a scale. Most professional writers seek the approval of their peers, readers, and editors and the success that comes with getting great stories printed, but don't normally go to Glass' lengths to reach those goals.

Jason Patric and Ray Liotta star in this film and its directed by Joe Carnahan who employs a very good visual style to an already familiar story. The film has a dark and gritty look about it that suggests a touch of \"Film Noir\". One scene in particular stands out and its the one where Patric and Liotta are in a cafe having coffee and talking. The scene is dimly lit with both characters seemingly in shadows. It suggests that both are shadowy figures and have something to hide. Carnahan creates a dark mood for the film that I found very effective. Nothing seems forced here and it creates an indelible aura of bleakness. These are the streets that these cops work in everyday and you can understand some of the personality flaws of the characters. Ray Liotta stands out here and its the type of performance that reminds us why Scorsese cast him in \"Goodfellas\" in the first place. He gained 25 pounds for the role and along with Tom Cruise and a host of others helped produce this film. All the hard work paid off and I hope studios remember him with more work. He\\'s always been a terrific actor and its hard to forget those eyes of his when he sinks his teeth into a role like this.

This is a story of bad cop and bad cop working together, which is a relief to me since the good cop plus bad cop pairing is too over done. Joe Carnahan shows that he is an extremely talented writer and director. I have found myself thinking back to this movie several times since seeing it. It has a unique quality and excellent style to it. It also does not hurt to have good writing and directing that was complimented with the great acting of Jason Patric and Ray Liotta. Jason Patric is Nick Tellis, an undercover narcotics officer. The movie opens with Tellis chasing a drug dealer through backyards and into a park until the chase ends with a shooting, the suspect gets hit, but so does a pregnant woman that was a bystander. The next scene takes place over a year later, and Tellis is in a boardroom meeting with a police board of inquiry. We find out that the pregnant woman that got shot lost her unborn child and that Tellis has been on an administrative leave all this time for over a year. The board offers him a deal, which is to solve the murder of a slain undercover narcotics officer named Michael Calvess. If he solves this murder, he will be fully reinstated with a choice assignment. Tellis storms out of the meeting declining the offer. A police captain played by Chi McBride follows Tellis out the room and is able to convince Tellis to reconsider. As Tellis starts to investigate the murder, he requests the help of Calvess' former partner Henry Oak played by Ray Liotta. Initially the police captain says that Oak is off limits to the Calvess case and mentions that Oak is unstable. Oak isn't just unstable, he is a brutal cop, and we see a few flashback scenes of Oak viciously beating up suspects. Police Internal Affairs is always on the look out to find Oak guilty of brutality or planting evidence or any of the violations of conduct that Oak is suspected of doing. What allows Oak to continue to roam around like a vigilante is his impressive work record, the majority of Oak's arrests end up with a conviction. Therefore, Tellis is able to get Oak back onto the case.\\nAs we see Tellis and Oak investigate, we see some very unusual characters and a couple of twists to the storyline. Of course Oak is quite brutal and Tellis is okay with using police brutality at times but is sometimes surprised at Oak's actions and methods. The movie ends with some shocking revelations.

Thank goodness that this film got bought up and received a bigger audience.  It is a shame that more people didn't go and see it but it still isn't bad for a film that was almost shutdown mid-shoot due to budget problems (ie, they didn't have any!).  The plot is a good cop thriller in the mould of the old 70's thrillers where the lines between good/bad, right/wrong are pretty blurred. The focus of the film is the mcguffin of the tunnel - what happened, who did what? but the film is much more than that, it has themes of family and scenes of violence and tension that move everything forward.

If you like this film it is worth hunting out the DVD just for the extras, Carnahan talks in detail about the reasons behind the composition of some shots and it is impressive to hear and understand his thought process.The cast are excellent, although really the film hinges on the two leads. Liotta is as good as he has ever been.  It would be easy to just accept his performance as a `powerhouse' but it also has sensitivity, emotion and layers to it.  Patric is also good, his themes with family and past are brought up well in a performance that accepts that he is very much secondary to Liotta.  Support from Busta Rhymes is minor but he plays it very well, not at all like many hip hop stars who do movies to enhance their bling-bling gangsta personae.  There are other solid support roles too, but it really is Liotta and Patric's film.As a cop thriller this harks back to darker days and it is very effective, with a solid plot and a good sense of the unknown until some solid twists near the end.  The film has an impressive style to it and, while Liotta deserves the praise, the success and feel of this film are down to the skills of Carnahan as both writer and director.  With his talented and underpaid crew he has turned a good script into a great film.\", 'rating': None, 'title': 'A really atmospheric and enjoyable thriller'}, {'movie_id': 'tt0272207', 'movie_title': 'Narc', 'review_body': 'Great acting in this film about a washed up detective with a wife who never seemed to stop nagging him about almost anything.

'Narc' bristles with energy, from its heart-stopping hand-held opening chase to its brutal, bloody showdown, all the while framed by cold claustrophobic street scenes.

Both detectives have personal reasons for wanting to solve the case and they pursue it obsessively.This is not a buddy movie, since Oak and Tellis are more antagonistic toward each other than companionable. There is a remarkable lack or humor - I cannot remember a single instance of comic relief.To say that we see the seamy side of urban life does not really do justice to what is shown. For example, we spend time (quite a bit of time in fact) in a room with a body in a bathtub that has been putrefying for a couple of weeks. When Tellis sees the headless body he vomits. The scene is filmed in such a way that you easily imagine the stench.Patric and Liotta are very good in their roles - they create believable characters.

Carnahan is clearly in love with the rugged action/genre pieces from the 60's and 70's that he grew up with, and every film he has made so far in his career has been reflective of that, starting with this excellent debut. He comes charging out of the gate as fast as his lead character breathlessly pursues a perp through a run down suburban neighborhood, a sequence of pure visceral brilliance that sets the tone and let's us know he means business. Jason Patric plays Nick, an under cover narcotics officer with a decorated past and the scars to show for it, working the dankest streets of motor city Detroit. When a recently slain fellow officer's case is reopened, he is picked to investigate, joined by the deceased cop's former partner, Lt. Henry Oak (Ray Liotta). In this case, nothing is what it seems, agendas are hidden well, and violence constantly simmers just below the surface of every interaction and exchange of dialogue. This is especially the case with Liotta, who gives a staggering career best performance as a cop on the edge of sanity, justifying his heinous actions on the body of his slain friend. No one knows how to lose their cool like Ray, but here he is downright terrifying, a wild eyed monster and the epitome of the guy not to trust, lest you be driven down the same destructive path. Nick uncovers more secrets than he ever wished to know, and it all comes full circle in an angry, pulse rocketing confrontation that serves as one of the best blow ups in the genre, and goes to show you don't need a huge epic gunfight to cap off your story with style and intensity. Carnahan wisely keeps the fireworks man to man, and intimate in nature, proving once again what intuition he has in the director's chair. Chi Mcbride is always reliable, here playing the gruff police captain, and Busta Rhymes proves yet again that he's one of the few rappers who can actually act, giving a pretty damn committed performance as a thug. Liotta owns this one in pure beast mode, but the team effort is what makes it so special, and a crime classic. Carnahan and Co. have done something timeless for crime films, and raised the bar on the intensity level one can attain when everything is in place, and firing on all cylinders.

Paired with the victim's volatile ex-partner, Henry Oak (Liotta), Tellis tries to hold it together as the case grows ever more complex the deeper he gets.Don't tune into this one if you want cartoon action and good cop/bad cop laughs, this is a perpetual downer, stripped to the bone, it's a portrait of damaged people in a shabby part of Detroit. The investigation is standard formula stuff, but it's with the characterisations, and the attention to detail of said characters, that lifts this to near classic status. Grit and grime rule the day, with the violence never gratuitous and pulsing with intensity. The mystery element of the case is strong, we constantly wonder what happened as we trawl through the avenues of red herrings and streets populated with scummy characters, but nicely Carnahan has us primarily concerned with what happens to Tellis and Oak as opposed to the slain copper they are investigating.

    "\n",
    "**Tokenization** is the foundational step of all text pre-processing. It's the process of breaking down a large block of text into smaller, meaningful units called tokens. In most cases, these tokens are individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why it's important: A machine learning model cannot directly process a full sentence or paragraph. By tokenizing the text, we create a list of words, which serves as the fundamental input for all subsequent steps. It's the first step in turning a sentence into data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopwords** are very common words in a language, such as \"the,\" \"a,\" \"is,\" \"and,\" and \"in.\" While grammatically necessary for humans, they usually do not carry significant meaning or sentiment on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization** is the process of reducing a word to its base or root form, known as its lemma. For example, the words \"running,\" \"ran,\" and \"runs\" all have the same lemma: \"run.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why it's important: Without lemmatization, the model would treat \"runs\" and \"ran\" as two completely different features. By reducing them to a single base form, we consolidate different word forms into one. This prevents data from being diluted, improves the model's ability to learn patterns, and reduces the overall dimensionality of the dataset, leading to better and more generalized performance."

    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes model is a very popular choice for text classification tasks like this, and for good reason. Despite its \"naive\" assumption, it often performs surprisingly well, especially for this type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a good fit for your sentiment analysis model:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simplicity and Speed:* Naive Bayes is an extremely fast and easy-to-implement algorithm. The training process is based on simple probability calculations, which means it requires less computational power and time to train compared to more complex models. This makes it a perfect baseline to establish the performance of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Handles High-Dimensional Data:* When you vectorized your reviews with TF-IDF, you created a matrix with potentially thousands of columns (words). This high-dimensionality can be a challenge for some algorithms, but Naive Bayes handles it with ease. It's designed to work efficiently with a large number of features, which is exactly what you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It's Probabilistic:* The model works by calculating the probability of a given word belonging to a certain class (e.g., \"amazing\" appearing in a positive review). The final prediction is based on which class has the highest probability. This probabilistic nature is a natural fit for sentiment analysis, where you're trying to determine the likelihood of a comment being positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Effective with a Bag-of-Words Approach:* Naive Bayes performs very well with the Bag-of-Words approach (which is what TF-IDF essentially represents). It assumes that the presence of a word in a review is independent of the presence of other words. While this is an oversimplification, it works exceptionally well in practice for text classification because the position of a word often doesn't matter as much as its presence."
